<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Every writer has his parish. To mine, I need offer no apology for
presenting,</p>

<p class="new_para">First, a new story which has never before appeared in print;</p>

<p class="new_para">Secondly, the &ldquo;hundred-dollar-a-column story,&rdquo; respecting the
remuneration of which, skeptical paragraphists have afforded me so much
amusement. (N. B.&mdash;My banker and I can afford to laugh!) This story
having been published when &ldquo;The New York Ledger&rdquo; was in the dawn of its
present unprecedented circulation, and never having appeared elsewhere,
will, of course, be new to many of my readers;</p>

<p class="new_para">Thirdly, I offer them my late fugitive pieces, which have often been
requested, and which, with the other contents of this volume, I hope
will cement still stronger our friendly relations.</p>

before the grate which had been carefully replenished with coal but half
an hour before; a stray cricket was hastily picked up and pushed beneath
the sofa, and an anxious glance was thrown around the room by Mrs. Wade
as her husband entered the room.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Too much light here,&rdquo; said the latter, as he turned down the gas
burner. &ldquo;I hate such a glare. Waste of coal, too; fire enough to roast
an ox, and coal seven dollars a ton;&rdquo; and Mr. Wade seized the poker and
gave the grate a vindictive poke.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Wade sighed&mdash;she had too long been accustomed to such scenes
to do any thing else. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> not the first time, nor the second,
nor the hundredth, that her unwearied endeavors to make home cheerful
had been met with a similar repulse; the young people, so gay but a
moment before, skipped, one by one, out of the room, closing the door
noiselessly behind them as culprit-like they glided away.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Heigh-ho,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Wade, as he threw himself down, boots and all,
on the sofa, &ldquo;heigh-ho.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Does your head ache?&rdquo; asked his patient wife.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I want my tea,&rdquo; growled Mr. Wade, without deigning a reply.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Wade might have answered&mdash;most women would&mdash;that it had
been ready this half-hour. She might also have said that she had just
come up from the kitchen, where she had been to see that his favorite
dish of toast was prepared to his liking. She might also have said that
she did not like to order tea till he had signified his wish for
it&mdash;but as I said before, Mrs. Wade had been too long in school not
to have learned her lesson well. So she merely touched her forefinger to
the bell, for Betty to bring in the tea.</p>

<p class="new_para">It was strong and hot&mdash;Mr. Wade could not deny it;&mdash;the milk
was sweet; so was the butter, the toast was unexceptionable, and enough
of it; the cake light, and the sweetmeats unfermented. Poor, ill-used
Mr. Wade&mdash;he was in that most provoking of all dilemmas to a
petulant temper, there was nothing to fret about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;There&#8217;s the door bell,&rdquo; he exclaimed, inwardly relieved at the idea of
an escape-valve; &ldquo;now I suppose I shall be talked deaf by that silly
Mrs. Jones and her daughter, or bored by that stupid Mr. Forney; it&#8217;s
very strange that a man can not enjoy his family one evening free from
interruption.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">No such thing&mdash;Mr. Wade was cheated out of a fresh growl; the new
arrival being a carpet-bag, and its accessory, Mr. John Doe, a
brother-growler, whom Mr. Wade would rather have seen, if possible, than
a new gold dollar. Mr. John Doe, as sallow as a badly-preserved pickle,
and about as sweet&mdash;a man all nerves and frowns&mdash;a walking
thunder-cloud, muttering vengeance against any thing animate, or
inanimate, which had the temerity to bask in the sunshine. Mr. John Doe,
a worse drug than any in his apothecary&#8217;s shop, who believed in the
eternal destruction of little dead babies; turned the world into one
vast charnel-house, and reversed the verdict of Him who pronounced it
&ldquo;very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Ah&mdash;how d&#8217;ye do&mdash;how dy&#8217;e do?&rdquo; said Mr. Wade, with an impromptu lugubrious whine, as Mr. Doe ran
his fingers through his grizzled locks, and deposited his time-worn
carpet-bag in the corner; &ldquo;it is pleasant to see a <em>friend</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Doe, lowering himself as carefully
into his chair as if he was afraid his joints would become unriveted;
&ldquo;there&#8217;s no knowing how many more times you may have to say that; these
sudden changes of weather are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> dreadful underminers of a man&#8217;s
constitution. Traveling, too, racks me to pieces; I can&#8217;t sleep in a
strange bed, nor get any thing I can eat when I wake, my appetite is so
delicate;&mdash;sometimes I think it don&#8217;t make much difference&mdash;we
are poor creatures&mdash;begin to die as soon as we are born&mdash;how
do you do, Mr. Wade? You look to me like a man who is going to have the
jaundice, eye-balls yellow, <abbr title="etcetera" class="silent">etc.</abbr>&mdash;any appetite?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said Mr. Wade, unbuttoning his lower vest button, under
which were snugly stowed away a pile of buttered toast, three cups of
tea, and preserved peaches enough to make a farmer sick&mdash;&ldquo;not
much;&mdash;a man who works as hard as I do, gets too exhausted to eat
when it comes night, or if he does, his food does not digest; how&#8217;s your
family?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; muttered Doe, with an expressive shrug; &ldquo;children are a great
care, Mr. Wade, a great care&mdash;my John don&#8217;t take that interest in
the drug business that I wish he did; he always has some book or other
on hand, reading; I am afraid he never will be good for any thing; your
book-worms always go through the world, knocking their heads against
facts. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder, after all my care, if he turned out a poor
miserable author; sometimes I think what is to be, will be, and there&#8217;s
no use trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Is not that fatalism?&rdquo; quietly interposed Mrs. Wade, blushing the next
moment that she had so far departed from &ldquo;The Married Woman&#8217;s
Guide,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> as to question an opinion which her husband had indorsed
by his silence. &ldquo;Children are a great care, &#8217;tis true, but it always
seemed to me that the care brought its own sweet reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Doe wheeled round to look in the face this meek wife, whose
disappointed heart, turning to her children for that comfort which she
had in vain looked for from her husband, could ill brook that the value
of this coveted treasure should have such depreciating mention.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Pshaw! what signify words?&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;I hate argument;
besides, women can&#8217;t argue&mdash;every body knows that; and every body
knows that if a man wants his children to do, or be, one thing, they are
sure to do, or be, just the opposite. I&#8217;ve no doubt it will turn out
just so with ours; there is no counting on &#8217;em. In my day, if a man was
a farmer, his son was a farmer after him, and never thought of being any
thing else. Nowadays, children have to be consulted as to &lsquo;their bent.&rsquo;
Fudge&mdash;fiddlestick; their bent is for mischief and dodging work,
and a tight rein and a good smart rod is the best cure for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Just at this point Mr. Doe gave a dismal groan, and doubled himself up
like a jack-knife. &ldquo;A touch of my old complaint,&rdquo; said he, holding on to
his waist-band. &ldquo;Rheumatism&mdash;it will carry me off some day. Mrs.
Wade, if you will be so good as to look in my carpet-bag, you will find
a plaster which I never travel without; and I will trouble<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> you, Mrs. Wade, to have my bed
warmed, and a fire in the room where you intend I should sleep; and if
there should be any cracks in the windows, will you have the goodness to
nail up a blanket over them? and I would like a very warm comforter, if
you please, and a jug of hot water at my feet, if it would not be too
much trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Mr. Wade, settling himself very comfortably down
into his ample easy-chair; &ldquo;of course not; Mrs. Wade, won&#8217;t you attend
to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;And, Mrs. Wade, if you&#8217;d be so kind as to put the feather bed
uppermost, and give me cotton sheets instead of linen; I should also
prefer a hair to a feather pillow: I consider feathers too heating for
my head; I am obliged to be careful of my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Wade. &ldquo;<span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Originally &ldquo;Mrs Wade&rdquo;">Mrs. Wade</span> will see to
it.&rdquo; And as she moved out of the room to execute these orders, these two
despondent Siamese drew their chairs closer together, to bemoan the
short-comings of two of the most long-suffering wives who ever wore
themselves to skeletons, trying to please husbands who were foreordained
not to be pleased.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Mother&#8217;s room! How we look back to it in after years, when she who
sanctified it is herself among the sanctified. How well we remember
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> ample cushioned chair, with its all-embracing arms, none the
worse in our eyes for having rocked to sleep so many little forms now
scattered far and wide, divided from us, perhaps, by barriers more
impassable than the cold, blue sea. Mother&#8217;s room&mdash;where the sun
shone in so cheerily upon the flowering plants in the low, old-fashioned
window-seats, which seemed to bud and blossom at the least touch of her
caressing fingers; on which no blight or mildew ever came; no more than
on the love which outlived all our childish waywardness&mdash;all our
childish folly. The cozy sofa upon which childish feet were never
forbidden to climb; upon which curly heads could dream, unchidden, the
fairy dreams of childhood. The closet which garnered tops, and dolls,
and kites, and whips, and toys, and upon whose upper shelf was that
infallible old-fashioned panacea for infancy&#8217;s aches and
pains&mdash;brimstone and molasses! The basket, too, where was always
the very string we wanted; the light-stand round which we gathered, and
threaded needles (would we had threaded thousands more) for eyes dimmed
in our service; and the cheerful face that smiled across it such loving
thanks.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mother&#8217;s room! where our matronly feet returned when <em>we</em> were mothers;
where we lifted our little ones to kiss the wrinkled face, beautiful
with its halo of goodness; where we looked on well pleased to see the
golden locks we worshiped, mingling lovingly with the silver hairs;
where, as the fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> grand-mamma produced, in alarming profusion,
cakes and candies for the little pets, we laughingly reminded her of

<em>our</em> baby days, when she wisely told us such things were &ldquo;unwholesome;&rdquo;
where <em>our</em> baby caps, yellow with time, ferreted from some odd bag or
closet, were tried on our own babies&#8217; heads, and we sat, wondering where
the months and years had flown between then and now; and looking
forward, half-sighing, to just such a picture, when we should play what
seemed to us now, with our smooth skins, round limbs, and glossy locks,
such an impossible part.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mother&#8217;s room! where we watched beside her patient sick-bed through the
long night, gazing hopelessly at the flickering taper, listening to the
pain-extorted groan, which no human skill, no human love, could avert or
relieve; waiting with her the dawning of that eternal day, seen through
a mist of tears, bounded by no night.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mother&#8217;s room! where the mocking light strayed in through the
half-opened shutters, upon her who, for the first time, was blind to our
tears, and deaf to our cries; where busy memory could bring back to us
no look, no word, no tone, no act of hers, not freighted with God-like
love. Alas!&mdash;alas for us then, if, turning the tablets, they showed
us this long debt of love unappreciated&mdash;unpaid!</p>

<p class="new_para">No blossoming plants luxuriated in the windows of Mr. Wade&#8217;s house; no
picture attracted attention upon the walls; with the exception of a huge
map<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> of the United States in the hall, their blank whiteness was
pitilessly unrelieved. The whole house seemed to be hopelessly given up
to the household god&mdash;utility. If Mrs. Wade ever had any womanish
leaning toward the ornamental, she had long since learned to suppress
it; and what woman, how poor soever she may be, does not make some
feeble attempt to brighten up the little spot she calls home? Beautiful
to me, for this reason, is the crude picture, the cheap plaster-cast, or
the china mug with its dried grass, or the blue ribbon which ties back
the coarse but clean white curtain under humble roofs. Who shall say
that such things have not a moral influence&mdash;a moral significance?
Who shall say that there is not more hope of that young man on the walls
of whose bachelor attic hangs a landscape, or a sweet female head,
though not &ldquo;by an old master?&rdquo; Who that has been so unfortunate as to
sojourn in that mockery of a home, called a boarding-house, has not,
when passing through the halls, and by the open doors of rooms, formed
favorable or unfavorable opinions of its occupants from these mute
indications of taste and character? Let no one, particularly if he has
children, wait till he can command the most costly adornments; have one
picture, have one statue, have one vase, if no more, for little eyes to
look at, for little tongues to prattle about.</p>

<p class="new_para">If Mr. Wade had but understood this! If he had but brushed from his
heart the cobwebs of his count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>ing-room&mdash;for he had a heart,
buried as it was under the world&#8217;s rubbish; if he had not circumscribed
his thoughts, wishes, hopes, aims, by the narrow horizon of his ledger.
If&mdash;If! Dying lips falter out that word regretfully;&mdash;alas!
that we should learn to live only when we come to die!</p>

<p class="new_para">I have said Mr. Wade had a heart, ossified as it now was by the
all-absorbing love of gain. At the age of seven years, he was left, with
a younger brother, the only legacy to a heart-broken, invalid mother,
who found herself suddenly thrown upon the world for that charity that
she had been accustomed to bestow. To say that she found none, would be
false; the world is not all bad; but there were months in which Mr.
Wade, then a bright, handsome lad, was glad to carry home to her and his
little brother, the refuse food of the neighbors&#8217; kitchens. They who
have felt in early youth the griping hand of poverty, unfortunately
learn to attach undue value to the possession of money. Day after day,
as the boy witnessed his feeble mother struggling vainly with her
fate&mdash;day after day the thought, for <em>her</em> sake to become rich,
haunted his waking dreams and his boyish pillow. With his arms about her
neck, he would picture the blessings and comforts of a future home,
which his more hopeful eyes saw in the distance. The road to it, to be
sure, was rough and thorny, but still it was there; no cloud of
adversity could wholly obscure it to the boy&#8217;s vision; and even in the
darkest night, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> he woke, in fancy the lamps gleamed brightly
from its curtained windows; and so the boy smothered down his swelling
heart, when the refuse food was tossed carelessly into his beggar&#8217;s
basket, and was thankful for the little job which brought him even a
penny to place in <em>her</em> hand, as an earnest of what should
come&mdash;God willing; and at night, when the younger brother shivered
with cold, John would chafe his chilled feet, and, taking him in his
arms, soothe him to blissful slumbers. That the world should ever chill
such a heart! That the armor buckled over it in so righteous a cause,
should contract around it and prove but its shroud!</p>

<p class="new_para">Nobly the boy struggled: they who are not fastidious as to the means,
seldom fail of securing the result they aim at. John Wade&#8217;s pride never
stood like a lion in his path; he heeded not the supercilious glance or
careless tone of his employers, so that he received the hard-earned
reward of his toil. At length, from loving money for what it would
bring, he learned to love it for its own sake; and when death removed
from him those for whom he toiled, he toiled on for love of the shining
dross. Pity that gold should always bring with it the
canker&mdash;covetousness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I have a great mind to go to bed,&rdquo; said Susy Wade, yawning; &ldquo;I&#8217;m not
sleepy, either, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> don&#8217;t know what do do with
myself; there&#8217;s that tiresome Mr. Doe down stairs&mdash;he croaks, and
croaks, and croaks, till I feel almost as sick as he pretends to. Now he
will keep mother nursing up his rheumatism, as he calls it, till ten
o&#8217;clock, when he is no more sick than she is, nor half so much; mother
never complains when any thing ails her; but I am not like mother; I am
not patient a bit. Were it not for mother, Neddy, I should like to sail
way off across the ocean, and never come back; I get so tired here at
home, and I know she does, too, though she never says any thing;
sometimes she sighs such a long sigh, when she thinks nobody hears her;
I should rather she would cry outright; it always makes me feel better
to have a good cry. I wish that our father was like Carey Hunt&#8217;s
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Neddy, fixing his humming-top&mdash;&ldquo;so do I&mdash;they
have such fun there. Tom told me that his father played games with them
evenings, and showed them how to make kites, and brought them home
story-books, and read them aloud, and sometimes the whole family go out
together to some place of amusement. I wonder what makes our father so
different from Tom Hunt&#8217;s father? Tommy always runs down street to meet
his father when he comes home, and tells him what has happened on the
play-ground; I wonder why our father never talks to us about such
things? I wonder how father felt when he was a boy&mdash;don&#8217;t you
suppose he ever played?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; said Susy, mournfully; &ldquo;I&#8217;m only fifteen, but I mean to
get married just as soon as I can, and then I won&#8217;t have such a gloomy
house, and you shall come and live with me, Neddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But mother&mdash;&rdquo; said Neddy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;O, mother shall come to see us all the time,&rdquo; said Susy; &ldquo;won&#8217;t we have
fun?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But perhaps your husband will be a sober man, like father, and won&#8217;t
want company, only people like Mr. Doe.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But my husband will be young, you little goose,&rdquo; said Susy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well&mdash;wasn&#8217;t father young when mother married him?&rdquo; said the
persistent Neddy, whirling off his top.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Susy, with a sigh, &ldquo;but it don&#8217;t seem as if he ever
was. Where&#8217;s the Arabian Nights, Neddy, that you borrowed of Tom Hunt?
let&#8217;s read a story.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Father made me carry it back,&rdquo; said Neddy; &ldquo;he said it was nonsense,
and I shouldn&#8217;t read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That&#8217;s just why I like it,&rdquo; said Susy; &ldquo;of course, nobody believes it
true&mdash;and I&#8217;m so tired of sense! Isn&#8217;t there any thing up in the
book-rack there, Neddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I&#8217;ll see,&rdquo; said Neddy, stretching his neck up out of his clean white
collar&mdash;&ldquo;I&#8217;ll see&mdash;here&#8217;s Moral Philosophy, Key to Daboll&#8217;s
Arithmetic, Sermons by Rev. John Pyne, Essays by Calvin Croaker, Guide

Letter Writer, Treatise on Pneumatics, Buchan&#8217;s Domestic Medicine. Which
will you have?&rdquo; asked Neddy, with a comical whine.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Susy, &ldquo;there&#8217;s father&#8217;s step.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Wade had come up to get his soft lamb&#8217;s-wool slippers for Mr. Doe,
that gentleman having experienced a chill in his left toe joint.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Playing top,&rdquo; said he, contemptuously, looking at Neddy; &ldquo;at your age,
sir, I was wheeling stone for a mason, in the day-time, and studying
arithmetic evenings. Where&#8217;s your Daboll, sir? Study your pound and
pence table; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s to be the making of you; how do you expect to
become a man of business without that? You&#8217;ll never drive a good
bargain&mdash;you&#8217;ll be cheated out of your eye-teeth. Get your Daboll,
sir, and Susy, do you hear him say it. Tops are for babies, sir; a boy
of your age ought to be almost as much a man as his father. How should I
look playing top? God didn&#8217;t make the world to play in.&rdquo; And Mr. Wade
and his lamb&#8217;s-wool slippers slipped down stairs.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;He didn&#8217;t make it for a work-shop either,&rdquo; thought Susy, as she took
down the offensive Daboll.</p>

<p class="new_para">They to whom the word father comprises all that is reverent, tender,
companionable and sweet, may refuse to recognize the features of this
portrait as a true likeness of the relation for which it stands; they
may well doubt&mdash;they whose every childish hope and fear was freely
confided to a pitying, loving, sympathizing heart&mdash;they whose
generous im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>pulses were never chilled by the undeserved breath of
suspicion and distrust&mdash;they whose overflowing love was never
turned back in a lava tide to devastate their fresh young
hearts&mdash;happy they for whom memory daguerreotypes no such mournful
picture! Still, let them not for that reason doubt, that through the
length and breadth of the land, are men and women who look back
sorrowing on what they might have been, <em>but for their blighted
childhood</em>!</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Blessed night!&rdquo; the words often fell from Mrs. Wade&#8217;s lips, as she
closed her chamber-door, and, laying her weary head upon her pillow,
sought oblivion in sleep.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Blessed night;&rdquo; the children did not hear it, for whose sakes she often
repressed the rising sigh, and sent back to their fountain the scalding
tears, and whose future, as her health and strength declined, she would
have trembled to contemplate, but for her faith in God.</p>

<p class="new_para">He did not hear it&mdash;one kind word from whom, one look, or smile, to
say that he appreciated all her untiring efforts, would have brought
back the roses of health to that faded cheek. He did not hear it, as he
sat there over the midnight-fire, with groaning Mr. Doe, ringing the
changes on dollars and cents, dollars and cents, which had come between
him and the priceless love of those warm hearts.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ay&mdash;Blessed night!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I think it must be time for Henry to come home,&rdquo; and the speaker
glanced at a little gold watch on the mantel. <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Opening quotation mark added">&ldquo;What a noise</span> those children are
making. I told them to keep still, but after all, I&#8217;m glad that they
didn&#8217;t mind me; the most pitiful sight on earth to me, is a child with a
feeble body and a large head, who never plays. Let them
romp&mdash;broken chairs are easier mended than broken spines; who would
be a slave to an upholstery shop, or a set of porcelain; who would keep
awake at night to watch the key which locks up a set of gold or silver?
Who would mew children up in the nursery for fear of a parlor carpet? My
parlor is not too good for my children to play in, and I hope it never
will be. Now I will go down and take out some cake for tea; how glad I
am Henry loves cake, because I know so well how to make it; who would
have thought I should have had such a good husband, and such a happy
home&mdash;poor mamma&mdash;and she deserves it so much better than I.
Sometimes I think I ought never to have left home while she lived, but
have staid to comfort her. Oh my children must be very&mdash;very happy;
childhood comes but once&mdash;but once.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">So said Mary Hereford, Mr. Wade&#8217;s married daughter, as she picked up the
toys, and picture-books, and strings, and marbles, with which her
romping children had strewed her chamber floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Mary Hereford was no beauty. She had neither golden brown, nor raven
hair; her skin was not transparently white, nor her eyes dazzlingly
bright, nor her foot and hand miraculously small. She was simply a
plump, healthy, rosy, cheerful little cricket of a woman&mdash;singing
ever at her own hearth-stone&mdash;proud of her husband&mdash;proud of
her children, knowing no weariness in their service. Many a beautiful
woman has wrung her white hands in vain for the love which lent wings to
this unhandsome, but still lovely little wife, dignified even the most
common-place employment, and made her heart a temple for sweet and holy
thoughts to gather.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, there comes Henry now,&rdquo; said Mary, and before the words were well
out of her mouth, her husband held her at arm&#8217;s length, and looked into
her face.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You have been sewing too steadily, little wife,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I must take
you out for a walk after tea. I shall get a sempstress to help you if
these children out-grow their clothes so fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mary laughed a merry little laugh; &ldquo;No such thing&mdash;I am not tired a
bit&mdash;at least not now you are here; beside, don&#8217;t you work hard
down in that close counting-room, your poor head bothered with figures
all day? Do you suppose a wife is to fold her hands idly, that her
husband may get gray hairs? No&mdash;you and I will grow old together,
but that is a long way off yet, you know,&rdquo; and Mary shook her brown hair
about her face. &ldquo;Come&mdash;now for tea. I have such nice cakes for you;
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> children have been so good and affectionate; to be sure they
tear their aprons occasionally, and perhaps break a cup or plate, but
what is that, if we are only kind and happy? Oh, it is blessed to be
happy!&rdquo; And Mary would have thrown her arms around her husband&#8217;s neck,
but unfortunately she was too short.</p>

<p class="new_para">The smoking tea and savory cakes were set upon the table&mdash;Followed
the children, bouncing and rosy&mdash;fairly brightening up the room
like a gay bouquet. With one on either knee, Henry Hereford listened,
well pleased, to tales of soaring kites, and sympathized with disastrous
shipwrecks of mimic boats, nor thought his dignity compromised in
discussing the question, whether black, blue, or striped marbles were
prettiest, or whether a doll whose eyes were not made to open and shut,
could, by any stretch of imagination, be supposed by its youthful mamma
to go to sleep. How priceless is the balm of sympathy to childhood! The
certainty that no joy is too minute, no grief too trivial to find an
echo in the parental heart. Blessed they&mdash;who, like little
children, are neither too wise, nor too old to lean thus on the Almighty
Father!</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Where&#8217;s my umbrella, Susan?&rdquo; said Mr. Wade, &ldquo;it is raining, and I am in
a hurry to go to my business.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is Sunday, Mr. Wade; did you forget it was Sunday?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Sunday!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Wade, in well-feigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> surprise, &ldquo;we
didn&#8217;t have salt fish, I believe, for dinner yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied his wife, penitently, &ldquo;but I believe it is the first time
it has been omitted since our marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It <em>was</em> an omission,&rdquo; said Mr. Wade, solemnly, as he laid aside his
hat and coat. &ldquo;Sunday, is it, Mrs. Wade, I wish I hadn&#8217;t got up so
early&mdash;I suppose you are going to take the children off to church,
are you not? I&#8217;d like to be quiet, and go to sleep till dinner time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Perhaps you would step over to Mary&#8217;s some part of the day,&rdquo; suggested
his wife. &ldquo;She came here yesterday to leave some nice jelly that she had
been making for me, and said you had not been there for nearly two
months.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Wade, &ldquo;I had as lief encounter a hornet&#8217;s nest as
those children of Mary&#8217;s; they are just like eels, slipping up and
slipping down; slipping in, and slipping out; never still. Mary is
spoiling them. The last time I was there I found her playing puss in the
corner with them; puss in the corner, Mrs. Wade!&mdash;how does she
expect to keep them at a proper distance, and make them reverence her,
as your Bible calls it, if she is going to frolic with them that way?
and Henry is not a whit better; they are neither fit to bring up a
family. Mary used to be a sedate, steady girl, before she was married; I
don&#8217;t know that I remember having ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> heard her laugh in her
life, while she was at home; I can&#8217;t think what has changed her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">His wife drooped her head, but made no answer.</p>

<p class="new_para">The cold, hard man before her had no key with which to unlock the buried
sorrows of those long weary years which Susan Wade was at that moment
passing in review.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes; I can&#8217;t think what has changed her so,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Wade; &ldquo;I think
it must be Henry&#8217;s fault&mdash;she was brought up so carefully; but
after all, a great deal depends upon the sort of man a woman marries. I
dare say,&rdquo; added he, complacently, &ldquo;<em>you</em> would have been a very
different woman had you married any body but me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered his wife, mournfully.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;To be sure, you would; I am glad you have the good sense to see it; I
consider that a woman is but a cipher up to the time she is
married&mdash;her husband then invests her with a certain importance,
always subservient to his, of course. Then a great deal depends, too, on
the way a man begins with his wife. Now I always had a great respect for
Dr. Johnson, for the sensible manner in which he settled matters on his
wedding day; it seems that he and his wife were to ride horseback to the
church where they were to be married. Soon after starting his bride told
him, first, that they rode too fast, then, too slow. &lsquo;This won&#8217;t do,&rsquo;
said he to himself; &lsquo;I must begin with this woman as I mean to go on;
she must keep my pace, not I hers:&rsquo; and so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> putting spurs to his
horse, he galloped out of sight; when she rejoined him at the
church-door, she was in tears&mdash;in a proper state of
submission&mdash;he never had any trouble with her afterward; it was
more necessary as she was a widow; they need an uncommon tight rein.
Sensible old fellow, that Johnson. I don&#8217;t know that I ever enjoyed any
thing more than his answer to a lady who was going into ecstasies at
some performance she had seen, and wondered that the doctor did not
agree with her; &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must remember that you are a
dunce, and, therefore, very easily pleased.&rsquo; Very good, upon my
word&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;very good; &lsquo;Doctor Johnson&#8217;s Life&rsquo; is the
only book I ever had patience to read; he understood the sex;
ha&mdash;ha&mdash;upon my word, very good&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr. Wade rubbed his
spectacles with such animation that he rubbed out one of the glasses.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Two and sixpence for getting excited!&rdquo; said he, as he picked up the
fragments; &ldquo;well&mdash;it is a little luxury I don&#8217;t often indulge in;
but really that old Johnson was such a fine old fellow&mdash;I like him.
Now take the children off to church, Susan; I want to go sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I hope he may never be sorry for sending that pale, sickly woman out in
such a driving rain as this,&rdquo; muttered Betty, as her mistress walked
over the wet pavements to church. &ldquo;If there&#8217;s a selfisher man than Mr.
Wade, I&#8217;d like to know it; well, he won&#8217;t have her long, and then maybe
he&#8217;ll think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> it. I would have left here long ago if it had not
been for her; it&#8217;s work&mdash;work&mdash;work&mdash;with him, and no
thanks, and that&#8217;s what is fretting the soul out of her; she can&#8217;t
please him with all her trying. And Miss Susan and Neddy&mdash;cooped up
here like birds in a cage, and never allowed to speak above their
breath; they&#8217;ll fly through the bars sometime, if he don&#8217;t open the door
wider; and Miss Susan getting to be a young lady, too&mdash;looking as
solemn as a sexton, when she ought to be frisking and frolicking about
like all other innocent young creturs. I used to get her down here, and
make molasses candy for her, but she has out-grown candy,
now&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t know what will come of it all. At her age I was
going to husking and quilting frolics, and singing-school; bless
me&mdash;what a time I used to have coming through the snow-drifts. I
really believe Isaiah Pettibone used to upset the sleigh on purpose. I
suppose I might have married him if I had been as forrard as some
girls&mdash;leastways I know he gave me a paper heart, with a dart stuck
through it; but when I look at Mr. Wade, I say it is all right&mdash;ten
to one he might have turned out just such a cranky curmudgeon. People
say that for every bad husband in the world, there&#8217;s a bad wife
somewhere to balance it; I don&#8217;t believe it&mdash;but, anyhow, if there
is, I wish they&#8217;d each torment their own kind, and not be killing off
such patient creturs as Mrs. Wade. I&#8217;ll go up stairs and put her
slippers to the fire, and then get something nice and hot for her<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> to take when she comes back. I used
to think that a poor servant-girl was not of much account in the
world&mdash;I don&#8217;t think so since I came here to live; I know it is a
comfort to Mrs. Wade to feel that somebody in the house is caring for
her, who is always doing for other people; and though she never says a
word about her troubles, and I am not the girl to let her know that I
see them, yet the way in which she says, &lsquo;Thank you, Betty; you are
always kind and thoughtful,&rsquo; shows me that, humble as I am, she leans on
me, and pays me a hundred times over for any little thing I do for her.
I think, after all, that God made nobody of so little account that he
could not at some time or other help somebody else. There&#8217;s the bell,
now! Mercy on us! there&#8217;s that croaking raven, Mr. Doe, coming here to
dinner; he will be sure to eat up every thing good that I make for Mrs.
Wade. I wonder how a man who is eternally grumbling and growling at
every thing the Lord has made, can have the face to gormandize His good
things, as Mr. Doe does. I&#8217;d either let &#8217;em alone, or say Thank
you&mdash;he don&#8217;t do nary one.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="new_para">The bleak winds of March were abroad, causing even the healthy and
rugged to shrink from their piercing breath, and fold more closely
around their shivering limbs the warm garments of winter; while the
delicate invalid, warned by his irritated lungs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> ventured not
beyond the equable temperature of his closely-curtained chamber.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Wade&#8217;s accustomed place at the table was vacant; her busy fingers
no longer kept the domestic treadmill in motion. Ah! how seldom we feel
till the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; is stricken down, how never-ceasing is the vigilance,
how tireless the patience that ministers to our daily
wants;&mdash;dropping noiseless, like the gentle dew, too common and
unobtrusive a blessing to be noticed&mdash;till absence teaches us its
value.</p>

<p class="new_para">Death had no terrors for Mrs. Wade. It was only when looking upon the
children whom she must leave behind, that she prayed, with quivering
lips&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">If in the thorny path her woman&#8217;s feet had trod, her daughter&#8217;s
trembling feet must walk! What human arm would sustain her? what human
voice whisper words of cheer? And Neddy&mdash;the impulsive, generous,
warm-hearted Neddy; quick to err&mdash;as quick to repent&mdash;what
human hand would weigh justly in the scales of praise and blame, his
daily deeds? What hand, save a mother&#8217;s, in uprooting the weeds, would
crush not the tender flowers? Oh, what mother, while pondering these
things in her heart, and looking round upon the dear faces, in the near
or distant prospect of dissolution, has not felt her heart-tendrils
tighten around them, with a vice-like clasp that almost defied
separation? Nature&#8217;s voice is clamorous; but over, and above,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> and through its importunate
pleadings, comes there to the Christian mother, the still, small
whisper, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Wade at first refused to believe in the reality of his wife&#8217;s
sickness. Women, he said, were always ailing, and fancying themselves
dying. But, as the parlor was vacated for the chamber, and the
easy-chair for the bed, and the doctor&#8217;s chaise stopped twice a day
before the door, and Mrs. Hereford left her own little family to sit
beside her mother, and Betty wiped her eyes with her apron every time
she left the chamber door&mdash;and, more than all, when Mr. Wade&#8217;s
toast was not browned as <em>she</em> used to brown it, and his favorite
pudding was wanting, and the lamp burned dimly on the lonely tea-table,
and his slippers were not always in the right place&mdash;he resigned
himself to what seemed inevitable, with the air of a deeply-injured man;
and slept as soundly at night, in the room next his wife&#8217;s, as if
death&#8217;s shadow had not even then fallen across the threshold.</p>

<p class="new_para">At breakfast he drove Betty distracted with orders and counter-orders
about egg-boiling and toast-making, after eating which, he drew on a
pair of creaking boots and an overcoat, and mounted to his wife&#8217;s room,
to go through the ceremony of inquiring &ldquo;how she was,&rdquo; holding the door
open for the cold wind to blow upon the invalid, while he received the
faint &ldquo;Easy, thank you,&rdquo; from lips that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> contracted with pain, as
the door closed after him in no gentle manner.</p>

<p class="new_para">No thought of his children disturbed Mr. Wade&#8217;s equanimity. He did not
see, day by day, the sorrowful face of his daughter lifted to his, as if
in search of sympathy; nor notice the tip-toe steps of the playful
little Neddy, as he passed to and fro, with messages from Mrs. Hereford
to Betty.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It&#8217;s infamous!&rdquo; said the latter, slamming herself down in one of the
kitchen chairs. &ldquo;<em>Is</em> that man made of flesh and blood, or is he not?
All last night, Mrs. Wade sat up in bed, with that dreadful distress for
breath, tossing her arms up over her head, and that man snoring away
like the seven sleepers. It&#8217;s infamous! Now, I&#8217;m no eaves-dropper: I
scorn it; but I was in the kitchen this morning, and the slide was open
through the closet into the basement, and I heard Mrs. Hereford say to
her husband, who had called to inquire after Mrs. Wade: &lsquo;Oh, James,
James, how can I love or respect my father?&rsquo; and she sobbed as if her
heart would break; and then she told him that the doctor had ordered
some kind of drugs to be burned in Mrs. Wade&#8217;s room to help her
breathing&mdash;something expensive&mdash;I don&#8217;t remember the name, and
Mr. Wade said the doctor was an old granny, and it was a useless
expense, and wouldn&#8217;t give his daughter the money for it. When Mrs.
Hereford had finished telling, I heard her husband say a word I never
expected to hear out of his mouth, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> kissed his wife, and
handing her his pocket-book, told her to get whatever was necessary. Oh,
dear; the Bible says, &lsquo;Honor your parents;&rsquo; but whether such a man as
that <em>is</em> a parent? that&#8217;s the question. Some of the ministers must
settle it; I can&#8217;t. But it never will be clear to me that bringing a
child into the world makes a parent. I don&#8217;t care what they say; it&#8217;s
clear as day-light that the Lord meant that after that they should see
&#8217;em safe through it, no matter how much trouble turns up for &#8217;em. When
I&#8217;m married, if I ever am, I&#8217;ll say this to my young ones: &lsquo;Now look
here; tell me every thing. If you are sorry, tell me; if you are glad,
tell me; if you are wicked, tell me; and I never, never, will turn away
from you, no more than I want God to turn away from me. And if you break
God&#8217;s laws and man&#8217;s laws, as I hope you won&#8217;t&mdash;if you love Him and
me&mdash;still, I never will shut my door in your face, <em>no matter what
you do</em>, no more than I want my Maker to shut heaven&#8217;s door in mine.&rsquo;
Now, that&#8217;s my notion of a parent. Whether I shall ever have a chance to
carry it out or not&mdash;that&#8217;s another thing; but as sure as I do,
there&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me; and it&#8217;s my belief that many a man has
swung on a gibbet, and many a woman has cursed God and man with her last
breath, for want of just that. As if food, and drink, and clothes was
all a child wanted, or a wife either, for that matter; as if that was
all a husband or a father was bound to furnish; as if that was all the
Lord would hold him account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>able for; as if that
was&mdash;gracious Gradgrind, there&#8217;s my toast burnt all <span

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">Thanks to Mrs. Hereford, who procured the herbs ordered by the doctor,
the poor sufferer was temporarily relieved.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Who is that, Mary?&rdquo; she asked, as she distinguished a strange footstep

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is Miss Alsop,&rdquo; replied Mary.</p>

<p class="new_para">No reply from the invalid, but a weary turning of the pale face toward
the pillow, and a gathering moisture in the eyes.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Come here, Mary&mdash;nearer&mdash;nearer&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Hereford bent her

Susan and Neddy&mdash;it is hard to leave my children to her keeping. If
I could but take them with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">As she said this, Betty beckoned Mrs. Hereford out of the room, saying
&ldquo;that Miss Alsop wished to see her, to inquire how dear Mrs. Wade had
passed the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Tell her,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;that she is very ill, and that I can not leave
her to receive visitors.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said Betty, returning, &ldquo;Miss Alsop says she is so weary
that she will sit and rest for half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Just half an hour before father comes home; then, of course, he will
invite her to partake his solitary dinner; that&#8217;s just what she came
for; mother is right; how strange that I never should have thought of
all this before!&rdquo; and a thousand little things now flashed upon her mind
in confirmation of what her mother had just said.</p>

<p class="new_para">Miss Alsop was an unmarried woman of forty, and presented that strange
anomaly, a fat old maid. Her teeth were good, her hair thick and glossy,
and her voice softer than the cooing of a dove; one of those voices
which are the never-failing herald of deceit and hypocrisy to the keen
observer of human nature. For years she had had her eye upon Mr.
Alsop, and actually claimed a sort of cousinly
relationship, which she never had been able very clearly to establish,
but upon the strength of which she had come, self-invited, twice a
month, to spend the day. The first moment Mrs. Wade saw her, she was
conscious of an instinctive aversion to her; but as she was never in the
habit of consulting her own tastes or inclinations, she endured the
infliction with her own gentle sweetness. No one who witnessed her
offering Miss Alsop the easiest chair, or helping her to the daintiest
bit on the table, would have supposed that she read the wily woman&#8217;s
secret heart. Not a look, not a word, not a tone betrayed it; but<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> when the weary day was over, and
Miss Alsop had exhausted all her vapid nothings, and, tying on her
bonnet, regretted that she must trouble Mr. Wade to wait upon her home,
Mrs. Wade, as they passed through the door, and out into the darkness,
would lean her cheek upon her hand, while tears, which no human eye had
ever seen, fell thick and fast.</p>

<p class="new_para">Not that Mr. Wade had any affection for Miss Alsop&mdash;not at
all&mdash;he was incapable of affection for any thing but himself and
his money; but Miss Alsop had a way of saying little complimentary
things to which the most sensible man alive never yet was insensible,
from the stupidest and silliest of women. What wonder that the profound
Mr. Wade walked into the trap with his betters? and though he would not,
for one of his money-bags, have owned it, he always left her doubly
impressed with the value of his own consequence. Then&mdash;Miss Alsop
knew how to be an excellent listener when occasion required, and Mr.
Wade was, like all egregious stupidities, fond of hearing himself talk;
and occasionally Miss Alsop would ask him to repeat some remark he had
made, as if peculiarly struck with its acuteness, or its adaptation to
her single-blessed-needs, upon which Mr. Wade would afterward pleasantly
reflect, with the mental exclamation, &ldquo;Sensible woman, that Miss Alsop!&rdquo;
Let it not be supposed that this depth of cunning was at all
incompatible with obtuseness of intellect&mdash;not at all&mdash;there
is no cunning like the cunning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> a fool. Yes&mdash;Miss Alsop
knew her man. She knew she could afford to bide her time; besides, were
personal charms insufficient, had she not a most potent auxiliary in her
bank-book, which placed to her spinster credit twenty thousand dollars
in the &ldquo;People&#8217;s Bank?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Wade sat propped up in bed by pillows, for the nature of her
disease rendered repose impossible; dreadful spasms&mdash;the
forerunners of dissolution&mdash;at intervals convulsed her frame. Pale,
but firm, the gentle Mary Hereford glided about her, now supporting the
worn-out frame&mdash;now holding to her lips the cup meant for
healing&mdash;now opening a door, or slightly raising a window, to
facilitate the invalid&#8217;s labored breathing.</p>

<p class="new_para">The fire had burned low in the grate, and when the gray light of morning
stole in through the half open shutter, and the invalid
would have replenished it, Mrs. Wade&#8217;s low whispered, &ldquo;I shall not need
it, Mary,&rdquo; gave expression to the fearful certainty which her own heart
had silently throbbed out through the long watches of that agonized
night. Not a murmur escaped the sufferer&#8217;s lips&mdash;there was no
request for the presence of the absent sleeper, who had promised &ldquo;to
cherish through sickness and health;&rdquo; no mention was made of the
children, who had been trustingly placed in the hands of Him who<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> doeth all things well, and who
wearily slumbered on, unconscious that the brightness of their
childhood&#8217;s sky was fading out forever. The thin arms were wound around
the neck of the first-born, about whom such happy hopes had once so
thickly clustered, and peacefully as an infant drops asleep. Susan Wade
closed her eyes forever; so peacefully that the daughter knew not the
moment in which the desolate word&mdash;&ldquo;motherless&rdquo;&mdash;was written
over against her name.</p>

<p class="new_para">Motherless!&mdash;that in that little word should be compressed such
weary weight of woe! It were sad to be written fatherless&mdash;but God
and his ministering angels only know how dark this earth may be, when
she who was never weary of us with all our frailties&mdash;she, to whom
our very weaknesses clamored more loudly for love, lies careless of our
tears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Henry!&rdquo; said Mr. Wade to Mr. Hereford, &ldquo;I had no idea, in fact&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t think&rdquo;&mdash;and the embarrassed man tried to rub open his still
sleepy eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t suppose, really, that Mrs. Wade would die
yet; women are so notional, and that doctor seemed to be encouraging
Mrs. Wade to be sick, as doctors always do&mdash;really I am quite taken
by surprise, as one may say; I don&#8217;t know any thing about these
things&mdash;I should like to have you do what is necessary. I suppose
it will not be considered the thing for me to go to the store to-day,&rdquo;
and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> looked for encouragement to do so in the face of his
disgusted son-in-law.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I should think not, decidedly,&rdquo; said Mr. Hereford, dryly.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Of course it would not be my wish,&rdquo; said Mr. Wade, &ldquo;when poor Susan

one&#8217;s inclination.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">And <em>vice versâ</em>, thought Henry, but he merely remarked that he would
take any message for him to his place of business.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Wade could do no less than accept his offer, so, after eating his
usual breakfast with his usual appetite, he paced up and down the
parlor; got up and sat down; and looked out at the window, and tried in
various ways to stifle certain uncomfortable feelings which began to
disturb his digestion. It was uncomfortable&mdash;very. The awe-struck
face of Betty as she stole in and out, the swollen eyes of the children,
the pallid face of Mrs. Hereford, who was trying to give them the
consolation she so much needed herself, and the heavy step of the
undertaker over-head performing his repulsive office. And so the day
wore away; and the form, that a child might have lifted, was laid in the
coffin, and no trace of pain or sorrow lay upon the face upon which the
death-angel had written Peace!</p>

<p class="new_para">Why did <em>he</em> fear to look upon its placid sweetness? No reproach ever
came from the living lips&mdash;did he fear it from the dead?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">How still lay the once busy fingers! What a mockery seemed the usual
signs and sounds of domestic life! How empty, purposeless, aimless,
seemed life&#8217;s petty cares and needs. How chilling this total eclipse of
light, and love, and warmth! Blessed they, who can ease their pained
hearts by sobbing all this out to the listening ear of sympathy. But
what if the great agony be pent up within the swelling heart till it is
nigh bursting? What if it be pent up thus in the gushing heart of
childhood? What if no father&#8217;s arms be outstretched to enfold the
motherless? What if the paternal hand never rests lovingly on the bowed
young head? What if the moistening eye must send back to its source the
welling tear? What if the choking sob be an offense? What if childhood&#8217;s
ark of refuge&mdash;mother&#8217;s room&mdash;echo back only its own restless
footsteps? O, how many houses that present only to the careless eye, a
blank surface of brick and mortar, are inscribed all over with the

invitation for them to spend that part of the day with her in which he
was absent at his business? Why tell of the invisible web the cunning
Miss Alsop was weaving? Why tell of her speedy success? Why tell of the
soft-eyed dove transformed by Hy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>men to the vulture? Why tell of

<em>his</em> astonishment, who prided himself upon his lynx-eyed and infallible
penetration of the sex, at being forced to drain to the dregs that
bitter cup he had held so unsparingly to the meek lips upon which death
had set his seal of silence? Why tell of that pitiful old age, which,
having garnered the chaff, and thrown away the wheat of a life-time,
finds itself on the grave&#8217;s brink with no desire for repentance,
clutching with palsied hands the treasure of which Death stands ready to
rob it!</p>

<h2>VISITING AND VISITORS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;When are you coming to spend the day with us?&rdquo; asked a lady of my
acquaintance of another. &ldquo;Spend the day with you, my dear!&rdquo; replied the
latter; &ldquo;I should be tired to death spending the day with you; maybe
I&#8217;ll take tea with you sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">I have often pleased myself imagining how the wheels of society would
creak greased with such honesty as that! and yet how many, if they but
dared to speak their real sentiments, would make a similar response.
Now, I respect that old lady; she had made good use of her years; she
probably knew what it was to talk at a mark for hours on the stretch, to
some one-idea-d statue, who, with crossed hands and starched attitude,
seemed re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>morselessly exacting of her weary
tongue&mdash;Give&mdash;Give! She knew what it was to long for dinner to
reprieve her aching jaws, or, at least, afford them a diversion of
labor. She knew what it was to be gladder to see one&#8217;s husband home on
such a day, than on any other day in the year; and she knew what it was
to have those hopes dashed to earth by that inglorious sneak selfishly
retreating behind his newspaper, instead of shouldering the conversation
as he ought. She knew what it was to have the hour arrive for her
afternoon nap (I <em>won&#8217;t</em> call it &ldquo;siesta,&rdquo;) instead of which, with
leaden lids, and a great goneness of brain and diaphragm, she must still
keep on ringing changes on the alphabet, for the edification of the
monosyllabic statue, who&mdash;horror of horrors!&mdash;had &ldquo;concluded
to stay to tea.&rdquo; She knew what it was in a fit of despair to present a
book of engravings to the statue, and to hear that interesting
functionary remark as she returned it, that &ldquo;her eyes were weak.&rdquo; She
knew what it was to send in for a merry little chatterbox of a neighbor
to relieve guard, and receive for answer, &ldquo;that she had gone out of
town!&rdquo; She knew what it was to wish that she had forty babies up stairs,
with forty pains under their aprons, if need be, that she might have an
excuse for leaving the statue for at least one blessed half-hour. She
knew what it was to have the inglorious sneak later to tea on that
wearisome day than ever before; and on his entrance, blandly and coolly
to unfurl a business letter, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> with a Chesterfieldian bow,
he hoped the statue would excuse him for retiring to answer; and she
knew what it was, five minutes later, to spy the wretch on the back
piazza reveling in solitude and a cigar. She knew what it was, when the
statue finally&mdash;(for every thing comes to an end <em>some time</em>, thank
heaven)&mdash;took protracted leave&mdash;to cry hysterically from sheer
weariness, and a recollection of pressing family duties indefinitely
postponed, and to think for the forty-eleventh time, what propriety
there was in calling her the <em>weaker</em> sex, who had daily to shoulder
burdens which the strongest man either couldn&#8217;t or&mdash;<em>wouldn&#8217;t</em>
bear. And so again, I say&mdash;sensible old lady&mdash;would there were
more like her!</p>

<p class="new_para">And yet we would fain hope that, like ours, this is but one side of her
experience. We would hope that she knew what it was to throw her arms
about the neck of a friend from whom she had no disguises; whose loving
eyes scanned&mdash;not the wall for possible cobwebs, nor yet the carpet
for darns, nor yet the mirror for fly-specks; but <em>her face</em>, to see
what sorrow Time, in his flight, had registered there, which by sympathy
she could lighten; what joy, which, by sharing, she could increase. We
hope she knew what it was to sit side by side with such a one at the
frugal meal&mdash;sweeter far than the stalled ox, for the love that
seasoned it. We hope she knew what it was to lounge, or sit, or stand,
or walk, or read, or sew, or doze even, in that friend&#8217;s presence, with
that perfect love which casteth out fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> We hope she knew what
it was to count the hours as they passed, not for their irksomeness, but
as a miser tells his hoarded gold; jealous, lest even the smallest
fraction should escape. We hope she knew what it was when she
unwillingly closed the door upon her retreating form, that shutting it
never so securely, kind words, good deeds, loving looks and tones, came
flocking in to people the voiceless solitude as with shining troops of
white-robed angels.</p>

<p class="new_para">And we hope she knew what it was to give the cup of cold water to the
humble disciple for the Master&#8217;s sake. We hope that the door of her
house and heart were opened as widely for the destitute orphan, in whose
veins her own blood flowed&mdash;who could repay it only with tearful
thanks&mdash;as for those who could return feast for feast, and whose
tongues were as smooth as their wine. And finally and lastly, lest we
ourselves should be making too long a visit&mdash;we hope the old lady
had no &ldquo;best chamber,&rdquo; with closed blinds; pillows as ruffled as the
chambermaid&#8217;s temper; forbiddingly polished sheets; smothering canopy;
counterpane all too dainty for tumbling; and pincushion, whose lettered
words one must not invade, even at the most buttonless extremity!
Blessings on the old lady: we trust her carpets were made to be trod
on&mdash;her chairs to sit down upon&mdash;and her windows to open. We
hope her house was too small to hold half of her friends, and too hot to
hold one of her enemies.</p>

<h2>OUR FIRST NURSE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Now sit down, and I will tell you all about it. Charley and I were
engaged. Youth comes but once, you know, and if we waited to be married
until we could furnish a house in fashionable style&mdash;well, you see,
we knew too much for that; we got married, and left other couples to
grow gray, if they liked, on the distant prospect of damask curtains,
gold salt-cellars, and trains of innumerable servants.</p>

<p class="new_para">Charley did not know the meaning of a &ldquo;club-house,&rdquo; and the shopkeepers
flashed their diamonds and satins in vain in my face; I never gave them
a thought. We had some nice books, and some choice engravings, presented
to Charley by an old antiquary who had taken a fancy to him. You might
have gone into many a parlor on which thousands had been lavished, and
liked ours all the better when you came back. Still, it wanted
something&mdash;that we both agreed; for no house can be said to be
properly furnished without a baby. Santa Claus, good soul, understood
that, and Christmas day he brought us one, weighing the usual eight
pounds, and as lively as a cricket. Such lungs as it had! Charley said
it was intended for a minister.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, now it was all right, or would have been, if the baby had not
involved a nurse. We had, to be sure, a vague idea that we must have
one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> <em>as</em> vague an idea of what a nurse was. We thought her
a good kind of creature who understood baby-dom, and never interfered
with any little family arrangements.</p>

<p class="new_para">Not a bit of it!</p>

<p class="new_para">The very first thing she did was to make preparation to sleep in my
room, and send Charley off into a desolate spare chamber. Charley! <em>my</em>
Charley! whose shaving operations I had watched with the intensest
interest; mixing up little foam seas of &ldquo;lather&rdquo; for him, handing him
little square bits of paper to wipe his razor upon, and applying nice
bits of courtplaster, when he accidentally cut his chin while we were
laughing. Charley! whose cravats I had tied to suit my fancy every
blessed morning, whose hair I had brushed up in elegant confusion, whose
whiskers I had coaxed and trimmed, and&mdash;well, any one, unless a
bachelor or old maid, who reads this, can see that it was perfectly
ridiculous.</p>

<p class="new_para">Charley looked at me, and I looked at him, and then we both looked at
the bran new baby&mdash;and there&#8217;s where she had us. You might have
seen it with half an eye, as she folded her hands complacently over her
apron-strings, and sat down in my little rocking-chair, opposite the
bed. I felt as though I was sold to the Evil One, as she fixed her
basilisk eyes on me when Charley left the room. Poor Charley! He did not
want to go. He neither smoked, nor drank, nor played billiards; he loved
home and&mdash;me; so he wandered up stairs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> down, sat with
his hands in his pockets staring at the parlor fire till he could bear
it no longer, and then came up stairs to get comforted. If you&#8217;ll
believe it, that woman came fussing round the bed after him, just as if
he were infringing some of her rights and immunities.</p>

<p class="new_para">What if he did bring me a sly piece of cake in his pocket? Who likes to
live on gruel forever? What if he did open the blinds and let a little
blessed sunlight in, when she tried to humbug us into the belief that
&ldquo;it would hurt the baby&#8217;s eyes,&rdquo; because she was too lazy to wipe the
dust from the furniture? What if he did steal one of her knitting
needles, when she sat there, evening after evening, knitting round, and
round, and round that interminable old gray stocking, my eyes following
her with a horrid sort of fascination, till my nerves were wound up to
the screaming point? What if I did tell him that she always set her
rocking-chair on that loose board on the floor, which sent forth that
little crucifying squeak, and that she always said &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; and was
always sure to get on to it again the very next time she sat down? What
if I did tell him that when she had eaten too much dinner, and wanted to
take a sly nap, she would muffle the baby up in so many blankets that it
could not cry if it wanted to, and then would draw the curtains closely
round my bed, and tell me that &ldquo;it was high time I took a nap?&rdquo; I, who
neither by stratagem or persuasion, could ever be induced to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> sleep in the daytime? I, who felt as
if my eye-lashes were fastened up to the roots of my hair, and as if
legions of little ants were crawling all over me?</p>

<p class="new_para">What if I did tell him that she got up a skirmish with me every night,
because I would not wear a nuisance called a night-cap? What if I did
tell him that she insisted upon putting a sticky pitch-plaster upon my
neck, for a little ghost of a cough (occasioned by her stirring the
ashes in the grate too furiously), and that when I outgeneraled her, and
clapped it round the bed-post instead, she muttered, spitefully, that &ldquo;a
handsome neck would not keep me out of my coffin?&rdquo; What if I did tell
him that she tried on my nice little lace collars, when she thought I
was asleep at night, and insisted on my drinking detestable porter, that
its second-hand influence might &ldquo;make the baby sleep?&rdquo; What if I did,
was he not my husband? Did I not tell him every thing? laugh with him?
cry with him? eat out of <em>his</em> plate? drink out of <em>his</em> cup of tea,
because being his, I fancied they tasted better than mine? and didn&#8217;t

<em>he like it, too?</em> Of course he did!</p>

<p class="new_para">What if I did tell him all this? Poor Charley! <em>he</em> was forlorn, too;
his cravats were tied like a fright all the time I was sick, his hair
looked like any other man&#8217;s, the buttons were off his pretty velvet
vest, and he had not even the heart to get his boots blacked. Poor
Charley!</p>

<p class="new_para">Well; that nurse had the impudence to tell us one evening &ldquo;that we acted
like two children.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> &ldquo;<em>Children!</em>&rdquo; <em>We!</em> <em>Us!</em> the parents of
that eight-pound baby! That was the last drop in our cup. Charley paid
her, and I was so glad when she went, that I laughed till I cried.</p>

<p class="new_para">Then we both drew a long breath and sat down and looked at the new
baby&mdash;<em>our</em> baby; and Charley asked me about its little sleeping
habits, and I told him, with a shake of the head, that I could not speak
definitely on that point; and then we discussed, in a whisper, the
respective merits of cribs and cradles, and the propriety of teaching
it, at an early period, that impressive line of Mrs. Hemans:</p>

<p class="new_para"> &ldquo;Night is the time for sleep;&rdquo;<br /></p>

<p>and then Charley got up, and exchanged his musical boots for a noiseless
pair of slippers, and changed the position of the shovel, tongs, and
poker, and oiled the creaking hinge of the closet door, and laid a chair
over the squeaking board in the floor, that he might not tread on it,
and with one eye on the baby, gently shaded the lamp; and then he looked
at me, and gave a little sort of congratulatory nod, and then he drew
off his vest and hung it over a chair, and then&mdash;out rattled a
perfect tempest of half dollars, quarters, shillings, and sixpences, on
the hearth! Of course, the baby woke (frightened out of a year&#8217;s
growth), and screamed until it was black in the face. In vain its poor,
inexperienced papa kissed it, scratching its little velvet face with his
rough whiskers the while! In vain we both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> walked the floor with
it. The fire went out, the lamp went; and just at daybreak it came to us
like a revelation, the sarcastic tone of that hateful old nurse, as she
said, &ldquo;Good-by; I hope you&#8217;ll get along <em>comfortably</em> with the dear
baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">And so we did. Do you suppose one night&#8217;s watching was going to quench
our love, either for the baby, or for each other? No&mdash;nor a
thousand like it! for, as Dr. Watts, or Saxe, hath it, &ldquo;it was one of
the kind that was not born to die.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE SHADOW OF A GREAT ROCK IN A WEARY LAND.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Man may turn his back upon Revelation, and feed upon the dry husks of
infidelity, if he will; but sure I am, that <em>woman</em> can not do without
her Saviour. In her happiest estate, she has sorrows that can only be
intrusted to an Almighty ear; responsibilities that no human aid can
give her strength to meet. But what if earthly love be poisoned at the
fountain?&mdash;what if her feeble shoulders bend unsupported under the
weight of her daily cross?&mdash;what if her life-sky be black with
gathering gloom?&mdash;what if her foes be they of her own
household?&mdash;what if treachery sit down at her hearth-stone, and
calumny await her without, with extended finger? What then&mdash;if no
Saviour&#8217;s arms be outstretched to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> enfold her? What if it be
&ldquo;absurd&rdquo; (as some tell her) that the God who governs the universe should
stoop to interest himself in her petty concerns? What if the Bible to
which she flies be &ldquo;a dead letter?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Come unto me all ye who are
weary and heavy laden&rdquo;&mdash;only &ldquo;a metaphor?&rdquo; What earthly accents can
fall upon her ear as sweet as these&mdash;&ldquo;A bruised reed will I not
break?&rdquo; Woman may be &ldquo;weak;&rdquo; but blessed be the weakness which leads her
to lean on that Almighty arm, which man in his pride rejects; listening
rather in his extremity, to the demon whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Curse God and die.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Woman may be &ldquo;weak;&rdquo; you may confuse her with your sophistries, deafen
her with your arguments, and standing before her in your false strength,
exclaim like the unbelievers of old&mdash;&ldquo;Away with him!&rdquo; and still her
yearning soul cries out, with a voice no subtlety of yours can satisfy
or stifle&mdash;&ldquo;<em>My</em> Lord and <em>my</em> God!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>TO LITERARY ASPIRANTS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">My heart aches at the letters I am daily receiving from persons who wish
to support themselves by their pens; many of these letters, mis-spelt
and ungrammatical, show their writers to be totally unfit for the
vocation they have chosen; and yet, alas! their n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>ecessities are
for that reason none the less pressing. Others, unexceptionable in these
respects, see no preliminary steps to be taken between avowing this
their determination, and at once securing the remuneration accorded to
long-practiced writers, who, by patient toil and waiting, have secured a
remunerative name. They see a short article in print, by some writer; it
reads easy&mdash;they doubt not it was written easily; this may or may
not be the case; if so&mdash;what enabled the writer to produce it in so
short a space of time? Long habit of patient, trained thinking, which
the beginner has yet to acquire.</p>

<p class="new_para">You are taken sick; you send for a physician; he comes in, stays ten
minutes, prescribes for you a healing medicine, and charges you three or
four dollars. You call this &ldquo;extortionate&rdquo;&mdash;forgetting the medical
books he must have waded through, the revolting dissections he must have
witnessed and participated in, and the medical lectures he must have
digested, to have enabled him to pronounce on your case so summarily and
satisfactorily. To return to our subject. These practiced writers have
gone through (as you must do), the purgatorial furnace which separates
the literary dross from the pure ore. That all who do this should come
out fine gold, is impossible; but I maintain, that if there is any thing
in a literary aspirant, this process will develop it, spite of
discouragement&mdash;spite of depression&mdash;nay, on that very
account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Now what I would say is this. Let none enter this field of labor, least
of all shrinking, destitute women, unless they are prepared for this
long, tedious ordeal, and have also the self-sustaining conviction that
they have a God-given talent. The reading community is not what it once
was. The world is teeming with books&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent.
Publishers have a wide field from which to cull. There is a great feast
to sit down to; and the cloyed and fastidious taste demands dishes
daintily and skillfully prepared. How shall an unpracticed aspirant,
whose lips perhaps have not been touched with the live coal from the
altar, successfully contend with these? How shall the halt and maimed
win in such a race?</p>

<p class="new_para">Every editor&#8217;s drawer is crammed&mdash;every newspaper office
besieged&mdash;by hundreds doomed to disappointment; not two thirds of
the present surfeit of writers, born of the success of a few, obtain
even a hearing. Editors have any quantity of MSS. on hand, which they
know will answer their purpose; and they have, they say, when I have
applied to them for those who have written me to do so, neither time nor
inclination to paragraph, punctuate, revise and correct the inevitable
mistakes of beginners, even though there may possibly be some grains of
wheat for the seeking.</p>

<p class="new_para">To women, therefore, who are destitute, and rely upon their pen for a
support, I would say, again, Do any thing that is honest that your hands
find to do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> but make not authorship, at least, your <em>sole</em>
dependence in the present state of things.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now, having performed this ungrateful task, and mapped out faithfully
the shoals and quicksands, if there are among you those whose mental and
physical muscle will stand the strain with this army of
competitors&mdash;and, above all, who have the &ldquo;barrel of meal and cruse
of oil&rdquo; to fall back upon&mdash;I wish you God speed! and none will be
happier than she, who has herself borne the burden and heat of the day,
to see you crowned victor.</p>

<h2>SUMMER TRAVEL.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Take a journey at this elevation of the thermometer! Not I. Think of the
breakfastless start before daybreak&mdash;think of a twelve hours&#8217; ride
on the sunny side of the cars, in the neighborhood of some persistent
talker, rattling untranslatable jargon into your aching ears; think of a
hurried repast, in some barbarous half-way house; amid a heterogeneous
assortment of men, women, and children, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Comma added">beef,</span> pork, and mutton; minus forks, minus spoons,
minus castor, minus come-atable waiters, and four shillings and
indigestion to pay. Think of a &ldquo;collision&rdquo;&mdash;disemboweled trunks,
and a wooden leg; think of an arrival at a crowded hotel; jammed, jaded,
dusty, and dolorous; think of your closetless sentry-box of a room,
infested by mosquitoes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> Red Rovers; bed too narrow, window
too small, candle too short, all the world and his wife a-bed, and the
geography of the house an unexplained riddle. Think of your
unrefreshing, vapor-bath sleep; think of the next morning, as seated on
a dusty trunk, with your hair drooping about your ears, through which
the whistle of the cars, and the jiggle-joggle of the brakeman, are
still resounding; you try to remember, with your hand on your bewildered
forehead, whether your breakfast robe is in the yellow trunk, or the
black trunk, and if in either, whether it is at the top, bottom, or in
the middle of the same, where your muslins and laces were deposited,
what on earth you did with your dressing comb, and where amid your
luggage, your toilet slippers may be possibly located. Think of a
summons to breakfast at this interesting moment, the sun meanwhile
streaming in through the blind chinks, with volcanic power. Think of all
that, I say.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now if I could travel <em><abbr title="incognito" class="silent">incog.</abbr></em> in masculine attire, no dresses to look
after, no muslins to rumple, no bonnet to soil, no tresses to keep
smooth, with only a hat and things, a neck-tie or two, a change
of&mdash;of shirts&mdash;nothing but a moustache to twist into a horn
when the dinner bell rings; just a dip into a wash-basin, a clean dicky,
a jump into a pair of&mdash;trowsers, and above all, liberty to go where
I liked, without being stared at or questioned; a seat in a chair on its
hind-legs, on a breezy door-step, a seat on the stairs in a wide hall,
&ldquo;taking notes;&rdquo; a peep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> everywhere I chose, by lordly right of my
pantaloons; nobody nudging somebody, to inquire why Miss Spinks the
authoress wore her hair in curls instead of plaits; or making the
astounding discovery that it was hips, not hoops, that made her dress
stand out&mdash;that now, would be worth talking about: I&#8217;ll do it.</p>

<p class="new_para">But stop&mdash;I should have to cut my hair short&mdash;I should have to
shave every morning, or at any rate call for hot water and go through
the motions; men would jostle rudely past me, just as if they never had
said such pretty things to me in flounces; I should be obliged, just as
I had secured a nice seat in the cars, to get up, and give it to some
imperious woman, who would not even say &ldquo;thank you;&rdquo; I should have to
look on with hungry eyes till &ldquo;the ladies&rdquo; were all served at table; I
should have to pick up their fans, and reticules, and handkerchiefs

<h2>A STORY FOR OLD HUSBANDS WITH YOUNG WIVES.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I was an old fool! Yes&mdash;I was an old fool; that&#8217;s all there is
about it. I ought to have known better; <em>she</em> was not to blame, poor
thing; she is but a child yet; and these baubles pleased her ambitious
mother&#8217;s eye. It was not the old man, but his <em>money</em>&mdash;his

<em>money</em>&mdash;I might have known it. May and December&mdash;May and
December&mdash;pshaw! how could I ever have believed, that Mary Terry
could <em>love</em> an old fellow like me?&rdquo; and Mark Ware surveyed himself in
the large parlor mirror.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;See!&mdash;it reflects a portly old man of sixty, with ruddy face,
snow-white hair, and eyes from which the light of youth has long since
departed.&rdquo; And yet there is fire in the old man&#8217;s veins too; see how he
strides across the carpet, ejaculating, with fresh emphasis, &ldquo;Yes, I was
an old fool!&mdash;an old fool! But I will be kind to her; I&#8217;m not the
man to ty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>rannize over a young girl, because her mother took her
out of the nursery to make her my wife. I see now it is not in reason
for a young girl like her to stay contentedly at home with my frosty
head and gouty feet. Poor little Mary! No&mdash;I&#8217;ll not punish her
because she can not love me; she shall have what she wants, and go where
she likes; her mother is only too proud to trot her out, as the wife of
the rich Mark Ware. If that will make them both happy, let them do it;
may be&rdquo;&mdash;and Mark Ware paused&mdash;&ldquo;may be, after she has seen
what that Dead Sea apple&mdash;the world&mdash;is made of, she will come
back and love the old man a little&mdash;may be&mdash;who knows? No
woman who is believed in, and well treated, ever makes a bad wife; there
never was a bad wife yet, but there was a bad husband <em>first</em>; that&#8217;s
gospel&mdash;Mark&#8217;s gospel, anyhow, and Mark Ware is going to act upon
it. Mary shall go to the ball to-night, with her mother, and I will stay
at home and nurse my patience and my gouty leg. There&#8217;s no evil in her;
she&#8217;s as pure as a lily, and if she wants to see the world,
why&mdash;she shall see it; and though I can&#8217;t go dancing round with
her, I never will dim her bright eyes&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That will do, Tiffy; another pin in this lace; now move that rose in my
hair a little to the left; so&mdash;that will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That will <em>do</em>!&rdquo; Tame praise, for that small Grecian head, with its
crown of braided tresses; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> full, round throat, and snowy,
sloping shoulders; for the round, ivory arms, and tapering, rose-tipped
fingers; for the lovely bosom, and dainty waist. Well might such beauty
dazzle Mark Ware&#8217;s eyes, till he failed to discern the distance betwixt
May and December.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mark Ware had rightly read Mary. She was guileless and pure, as he had
said; and child as she was, there was that in her manner, before which
the most libidinous eye would have shrunk abashed.</p>

<p class="new_para">When the young bride first realized the import of those words she had
been made to utter, &ldquo;till death do us part,&rdquo; she looked forward, with
shuddering horror, at the long, monotonous, weary years before her. Her
home seemed a prison, and Mark Ware the keeper; its very splendor
oppressed her; and she chafed and fretted in her gilded fetters, while
her restless heart cried out&mdash;anywhere but home! Must she sit
there, in her prison-house, day after day, listening only to the
repinings of her own troubled heart? Must the bee and the butterfly only
be free to revel in the bright sunshine? Had God made her beauty to fade
in the stifling atmosphere of darkened parlors, listening to the
complaints of querulous old age? Every pulse of her heart rebelled. How
could her mother have thus sold her? How could Mark Ware have so
unmagnanimously accepted the compulsory sacrifice? Why not have shown
her the world and let her choose for herself? O
anywhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;from such a home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">There was no lack of invitations abroad; for Mary had flashed across the
fashionable horizon, like some bright comet; eclipsing all the reigning
beauties. No ball, no party, no dinner, was thought a success without
her. Night after night found her <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></em> to some gay assemblage. To
her own astonishment and her foolish mother&#8217;s delight, her husband never
remonstrated; on the contrary, she often found upon her dressing-table,
some choice little ornament, which he had provided for the occasion; and
Mary, as she fastened it in her hair, or bosom, would say, bitterly, &ldquo;He
is anxious that I, like the other appendages of his establishment,
should reflect credit on his faultless taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mistaken Mary!</p>

<p class="new_para">Time passed on. Mark Ware <em>was</em> &ldquo;patient,&rdquo; as he promised himself to be.
His evenings were not so lonely now, for his little babe kept him
company; the reprieved nurse, only too glad to escape to her pink
ribbons and a &ldquo;chat with John at the back gate.&rdquo; It was a pretty
sight&mdash;Mark and the babe! Old age and infancy are always a touching
sight together. Not a smile or a cloud passed over that little face,
that did not wake up all the father in Mark Ware&#8217;s heart; and he paced
the room with it, or rocked it to sleep on his breast, talking to it, as
if it could understand the strong, deep love, of which it was the
unconscious object.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I am weary of all this,&rdquo; said Mark&#8217;s young wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> as she stepped
into her carriage, at the close of a brilliant ball. &ldquo;I am weary of
seeing the same faces, and hearing the same stupid nonsense, night after
night. I wonder shall I <em>ever</em> be happy? I wonder shall I ever <em>love</em>
any thing, or anybody? Mamma is proud of me, because I am beautiful and
rich, but she does not <em>love</em> me. Mark is proud of me&rdquo;&mdash;and Mary&#8217;s
pretty lip curled scornfully. &ldquo;Life is so weary, and I am only
eighteen!&rdquo; and Mary sighed heavily.</p>

<p class="new_para">On whirled the carriage through the deserted streets;
deserted&mdash;save by some inveterate pleasure-seeker like herself,
from whom pleasure forever flees. Occasionally a lamp twinkled from some
upper window, where a half-starved seamstress sat stitching her life
away, or a heart-broken mother bent over the dead form of a babe, which
her mother&#8217;s heart could ill spare, although she knew not where to find
bread for the remaining babes who wept beside her. Now and then, a
woman, lost to all that makes woman lovely, flaunted under the
flickering street-lamps, while her mocking laugh rang out on the night
air. Mary shuddered, and drew back&mdash;there was that in its
hollowness which might make even devils tremble. Overhead the sentinel
stars kept their tireless watch, and Mary&#8217;s heart grew soft under their
gentle influence, and tears stole from beneath her lashes, and lay like
pearls upon her bosom.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You need not wait to undress me,&rdquo; said Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> to the
weary-looking waiting-maid, as she averted her swollen eyes from her
gaze&mdash;and taking the lamp from her hand, Mary passed up to her
chamber. So noiseless was the fall of her light foot upon the carpet,
that Mark did not know she had entered. He sat with his back to the
door, bending over the cradle of his child, till his snow-white locks
rested on its rosy cheeks; talking to it, as was his wont, to beguile
his loneliness.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Mary&#8217;s forehead&mdash;Mary&#8217;s eyes&mdash;Mary&#8217;s mouth&mdash;no more like
your old father than a rosebud is like a chestnut-burr. <em>You</em> will love
the lonely old man, little one, and perhaps <em>she</em> will, by-and-by; who
knows?&rdquo; and Mark&#8217;s voice trembled.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;She will&mdash;she does&rdquo;&mdash;said Mary, dropping on her knees at the
cradle of her child, and burying her face in Mark&#8217;s hands; &ldquo;my noble,
patient husband!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean that?&rdquo; said Mark, holding her off at arm&#8217;s-length, and
looking at her through a mist of tears; &ldquo;you don&#8217;t mean that you will
love an old fellow like me? God bless you, Mary&mdash;God forever bless
you! I have been very&mdash;very lonely,&rdquo;&mdash;and Mark wept for sheer
happiness.</p>

No, I shan&#8217;t either: may I be kissed if Pax has not sat down to read

<h2>GIRLS&#8217; BOARDING-SCHOOLS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Had I twenty daughters, which I regret to say I have not, not one of
them should ever enter a &ldquo;Boarding-school.&rdquo; I beg pardon; I should say
&ldquo;Institute;&rdquo; schools are exploded; every two-year-older learns his A B C
now at an &ldquo;Institute,&rdquo; though that institute, when hunted down, may
consist of a ten-feet-square basement room. But this is a digression.</p>

<p class="new_para">To every mother who is contemplating sending her daughter to a
boarding-school I would say: Let neither your indolence, nor the
omnipotent voice of fashion, nor high-sounding circulars, induce you to
remove her from under your own personal care and supervision, at a time
when the physique of this future wife and mother requires a lynx-eyed
watchfulness on your part, which no institute ever has&mdash;ever will
supply. This is a point which I am astonished that parents seem so
utterly to overlook. Every mother knows how fatal wet feet, or
insufficient clothing, may be to a young girl at the critical age at
which they are generally sent away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> school. It is not enough
that you place <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Comma added">India-rubbers,</span> thick-soled shoes, and flannels in the
trunk which bears the little exile company; they will not insure her
from disease <em>there</em>. It is not enough that you say to her, &ldquo;My dear, be
careful of your choice of companions,&rdquo; when she <em>has</em> no choice; when
her bed-fellows and room-mates&mdash;the latter often three or four in
number&mdash;are what chance and the railroads send; for what teacher,
with the best intentions, ever gives this subject the attention which it
deserves, or which a mother&#8217;s anxious heart asks? That the distant home
of her daughter&#8217;s room-mates is located within the charmed limits of
fashion; that a carriage with liveried servants (that disgusting libel
on republicanism), stands daily before their door; that the dresses of
these room-mates are made in the latest style, and their wrists and ears
decked with gold and precious stones&mdash;is an affirmative answer to
these questions to satisfy a true mother?</p>

<p class="new_para">No&mdash;and it is not the blushing country maiden, with her simple
wardrobe, and simpler manners, whom that mother has to fear for her
child&#8217;s companion or bed-fellow. It is the over-dressed, vain, vapid,
brainless offshoot of upstart aristocracy, who would ridicule the simple
gingham in which that country girl&#8217;s mother studied geography, and which
fabric she very properly considers quite good enough for her child, and
which is much more appropriate in the school-room than silk or satin. It
is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> child of the upstart rich mother, whose priceless
infancy and childhood have been spent with illiterate servants; with the
exception of the hour after dessert, when she was reminded that she had
a mother, by being taken in an embroidered robe to be exhibited for a
brief space to her guests. It is this girl, whose childhood, as I said,
has been passed with servants, peeping into the doubtful books with
which doubtful servants often beguile the tedious hours (for there are
bad servants as well as bad masters and mistresses)&mdash;this girl,
lying awake in her little bed, hearing unguarded details of servants&#8217;
amours, while her mother dances away the hours so pregnant with fate to
that listening child. It is such a girl, more to be pitied than blamed,
whose existence is to be recognized by her thoughtless mother only, when
her &ldquo;coming out,&rdquo; delayed till the latest <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Originally &ldquo;posssible&rdquo;">possible</span> period, forces her
reluctantly to yield to a younger aspirant her own claims to admiration.
This girl whose wealth, and the social position arising from it, so
dazzles the eyes of proprietors of &ldquo;Institutes&rdquo; that they are incapable
of perceiving, or unwilling to admit, her great moral and mental
delinquencies; it is <em>such</em> a companion that a true mother has to fear
for her pure-minded, simple-hearted young daughter, leaving for the

<p class="new_para">Well, I turned over the pages, and read with moistened eyes, for the
hundredth time, the wretched state farce enacted at the divorce; and
with fresh admiration perused the magnanimous and memorable reply of the
queenly Josephine, to the brilliant but cold, intellectual but selfish,
imperious yet fascinating Napoleon. Ah! then I would have led away his
victim, spite of herself, out of sight, sound, and hearing of this cold,
cruel man, who, when it suited his whim, caprice, or convenience; who,
when weary of the tame, spiritless Maria Louise, returned secretly to
the intoxicating presence of the bewitching Josephine; whom, though
repudiating, he yet controlled, down to the lowest menial in her
household, down to the color of their jackets and hose; quite safe, in
always appending, with gracious condescension, permission &ldquo;to please
herself,&rdquo; to one whose greatest pleasure, he well knew, was to kiss his
imperial shoe-tie.</p>

<p class="new_para">My love and pity for her merge (momentarily) into contempt, when she
abjectly begs for the crumbs of his favor, that fall from happier
favorites; for (to quote the touching words of her who would have shared
his exile had not death prevented, when the woman for whom she had been
cast aside, by a retributive justice, deserted him in his extremity) &ldquo;he
could forget me <em>when he was happy</em>!&rdquo; Ay, it was when pleasure palled,
when friends proved false, when the star of his destiny paled, when he

<em>needed</em> the noble Josephine, that he sought her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">And <em>she</em>? When pealing bells and roaring cannon announced to France
that her rival had presented her husband the long-desired heir; <em>she</em>,
upon whose quivering heart every stroke of those joyous bells must have
smitten like a death-knell; <em>she</em>, the deserted wife, hung festal
wreaths over the grave of her hopes, gave jewels to the messenger who
brought her the news of <em>his</em> happiness, and ordered a <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></em> in honor
of the young heir. Match me that, who can, in the wide annals of <em>man&#8217;s</em>
history? But, oh! when midnight came on, and garlands drooped, and
bright eyes closed, and tripping feet were stilled, when the farce was
played out, and the iron hand of court etiquette was lifted from off
that loving, throbbing, bursting heart, it thus poured itself out to
Napoleon:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;She (Maria Louise), can not be more tenderly devoted to you than I; but
she has been enabled to contribute more to your happiness, by securing
that of France. She has then a right to your first feelings, to all your
cares; and I, who was but your companion in times of difficulty, I can
not ask more than a place in your affections far removed from that
occupied by the Empress Louise. <em>Not till you shall have ceased to watch
by her bed, not till you are weary of embracing your son, will you take
the pen to converse with your best friend. I will wait.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The answer to the touching letter, from which this is an extract (and
every <em>woman</em> with a heart, who reads it, can measure the height and
depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> its anguish), was the following <em>verbal</em>, the following

<em>delicate</em> message, through Eugene!</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Tell your mother I would have written to her already, <em>had I not been
completely absorbed in the pleasure of looking upon my son</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">About eleven o&#8217;clock that evening she received the much-coveted line
from his own hand; in which he seemed to have been able at last to
remember somebody beside himself; and for which the all-enduring,
all-forgiving Josephine adores as a god, &ldquo;the man who, <em>when he willed</em>,
could be the most delightful of men.&rdquo; Nobody will deny the matchless
tact of the lines which dried poor Josephine&#8217;s tears:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;This infant, <em>in concert with our Eugene</em>, will constitute my
happiness, and that of France.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">But the man &ldquo;who could be so delightful when he willed,&rdquo; did not, any
more than the rest of his sex, always will it. Motes and butterflies
seek the sunbeams, and the friends of poor Josephine&#8217;s happier days,
forsook her for those whom Fortune smiled upon. Malice, always on tiptoe
to whisper into the tortured ear, told her of the &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; of the
inconstant Napoleon; and with the birds, flowers, and fountains of
Malmaison mocking her tears, her crushed heart thus sobs itself out to
the emperor:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I limit myself in asking one favor; it is, that you, yourself, will
seek means, <em>sometimes to convince me, and those who surround
me</em>&rdquo;&mdash;(mark how strong and deathless must be the love that could
thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> abjectly sue)&mdash;&ldquo;that I have still a place in your
memory, and a large share of your esteem and friendship. These means,
whatever they may be, will soothe my anguish, without the danger, as it
seems to me, of compromising that <em>which is more important than all
together, the happiness of your majesty</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, what was the answer of &ldquo;his majesty&rdquo; to the tortured Josephine, in
whose heart, his majesty boasted that &ldquo;he held the first place, and her
children by a former husband next, and that she did right thus to love
him!&rdquo; What was his majesty&#8217;s answer to her, whom he wished to &ldquo;cover
with kisses burning as the equator,&rdquo; &ldquo;whom he would wish to imprison in
his heart, lest she should escape;&rdquo; &ldquo;the beautiful, the good one, all
unequaled, all divine,&rdquo; to whom he had &ldquo;sent thousands of kisses,
burning as his heart, pure as her own,&rdquo; whom &ldquo;he loved <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la fureur</span></em>?&rdquo;
What was his majesty&#8217;s answer to the weary, weeping, faithful watcher at
Malmaison?</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I have received your letter of the 19th of April; it <em>is in a very bad
style</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Could any thing be more coolly diabolical? O, foolish Josephine! with
all your tact and wisdom, not to have found out that man (with rare
exceptions) is unmagnanimous; that to pet and fondle him is to forge
your own chains; that the love which is sure is to him worthless; that
variety is as necessary to his existence, as a looking-glass and a<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> cigar; and that his vows are made,
like women&#8217;s hearts, to break.</p>

<p class="new_para">And yet, how surely, even in this world, retribution follows. The dreary
rock of St. Helena; the dilapidated, vermin-infested lodgings; the
petty, grinding, un-let-up-able tyranny of the lynx-eyed foe; the
unalloyed, unassuaged anguish of hydra-headed disease; the merciless
separation from the child, who had dug poor Josephine&#8217;s premature grave;
the heaped up, viper, newspaper obloquy which had always free pass to
Longwood, when bristling bayonets kept at bay the voices which the ear
of its captive ached to hear; the dreary, comfortless death-bed; the
last faltering request denied; as if malice still hungered for vengeance
when the weary heart it would torture had lost all power to feel.
Josephine! Josephine! thou wert indeed avenged!</p>

<h2>&ldquo;FIRST PURE.&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="new_para">I would that I had time to answer the many kind letters I receive from
my unknown friends, or power, as they seem to imagine, to reform the
abuses to which they call my attention. The subject of licentiousness,
upon which I have just received a letter, is one upon which I have
thought much and often since my residence in New York. I could not, if I
would, ignore it, when at every step its victims ru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>stle past me
in the gay livery of shame, or stretch out to me, from beneath tattered
garments, the hand, prematurely old, which should, alas! wear the golden
pledge of honorable love. But they tell me this is a subject a woman can
not understand, and should not write about. Perhaps so; but woman can
understand it when, like a blighting mildew, it strips bud, blossom, and
verdure, from her household olive-plants; woman can understand it when
she weeps in secret over the wrong which she may not whisper even to
herself; woman can understand it when the children of the man whom she
thought worthy of her maidenly love and honor, sink into early graves,
under the inherited taint of his &ldquo;youthful follies.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">And yet they are right; virtuous woman does <em>not</em> understand it; would
that she did&mdash;would that she sometimes paused to think of her share
of blame in this matter; would that she know how much her ready smile,
and <em>indiscriminate hand of welcome</em> has to do in perpetuating it; how
often it blunts the sting of conscience, and confirms the immoral man in
that detestable club-house creed, that woman&#8217;s virtue depends upon
opportunity. Would that mothers would sometimes ask, not&mdash;is he a
gentleman, or is he accomplished? but, is he moral? is he pure? Pure!
Young New York holds its sides in derision at the word. Pure! is he in
leading strings? Pure! it is a contemptible reflection on his man<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>hood and free will. Pure! it is a
word for old women and priests.</p>

<p class="new_para">I once expressed my astonishment to a lady, that she should permit the
calls of a gentleman whom she knew to be licentious. &ldquo;That is none of my
business, you know, my dear,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;so long as he behaves
himself properly in my presence;&rdquo; and this answer, I am afraid, would be
endorsed by too many of my readers. As well might she have said, that it
was none of her business that her neighbor&#8217;s house was in flames, or
that they had the yellow fever or the plague. That a man sings well,
dresses well, or talks well, is, I am sorry to say, too often sufficient
to outweigh his moral delinquency. This is poor encouragement to young
men who, not having yet learned to think lightly of the sex to which
their mothers and sisters belong, are old-fashioned enough to wish to
lead virtuous lives; and some of whom, notwithstanding, have the courage
and manhood in these degenerate days to <em>dare</em> to do it.</p>

<p class="new_para">As to a reform in this matter, I think virtuous women must begin it, by
turning the cold shoulder to every man of their acquaintance whom they
know to be immoral, and I think a woman of penetration will not be at
fault, if she takes pains to sift a man&#8217;s sentiments in conversation.</p>

<p class="new_para">Perhaps you will tell me (though I hope it is not so), that this would
exclude two thirds of every lady&#8217;s gentlemen acquaintance. Be it so;
better for those ladies, better for their daughters, if they have<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> any, better for the cause of virtue;
at least, it would not take long, at that rate, to thin the ranks of
vice.</p>

<p class="new_para">I wonder does man never think, in his better moments, how much nobler it
were to protect than to debase woman?&mdash;ay, protect her&mdash;if
need be&mdash;<em>even from herself</em>, and ignoring the selfish creed that
she has a right to, and is alone responsible for, her own self-disposal,
withdraw her, as with a brother&#8217;s hand, from the precipice over which
misery or inclination would plunge her, and prove to the &ldquo;weaker sex&rdquo;
that he is in the noblest sense the stronger. That, indeed, were
God-like.</p>

<h2>HOLIDAY THOUGHTS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Well&mdash;New Year&#8217;s and Christmas are both over: there is a lull equal
to that after a Presidential election. What is to be done for an
excitement now? Every body is yawning: the men on account of the number
of complimentary fibs that they foolishly felt themselves called upon to
tell the ladies, on their New Year&#8217;s calls; and the ladies, because they
were obliged to listen as if they did not know them all stereotyped, to
be repeated, <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></em>, at every house on their visiting rounds;
the matron, because her handsome carpet is inch-deep in cake crumbs; and
her husband, because bills are pouring in from butchers, bakers,
grocers, milkmen, tailors, dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>makers, and jewelers, like the
locusts of Egypt. Well&mdash;we shall not say any thing against New
Year&#8217;s and its jollities, while it frees the poor hack of a clerk, and
gives him one day of happiness and rest; while it throws over the
indefatigable cook&#8217;s shoulders the cloak for which she has been vainly
toiling and hoping; while it wings the feet of so many bright-eyed
children, and lights up the prim parlor of so many hopeless old maids.
We shall not say any thing against New Year&#8217;s, when, after long months
of wrong and estrangement, it stretches out the tardy hand of
repentance, for which even the Bible bids us to wait, ere we forgive; we
shall not say any thing against New Year&#8217;s, though it reminds us that
hands we used to grasp so warmly, are crossed forever over pulseless
hearts; though memories sad, but sweet, come thronging thick and fast,
of &ldquo;Happy New Years,&rdquo; from lips upon which Death has set his final seal.
And yet <em>not</em> final; thank Him who giveth, and Him who taketh, <em>not</em>
final; for even here we trace their noiseless footsteps&mdash;even here
we see the flitting of their shadowy garments&mdash;even here we smile
in dreams, at the overshadowing wings of the angels who &ldquo;have charge to
keep us.&rdquo; No, no&mdash;<em>not</em> final: our love o&#8217;erleaps the dark river,
to greet the sister, amid whose orange wreath there crept the cypress
vine; to clasp the child, who quickened our heart-throbs ere we saw the
lips that called us (alas, for so brief a space), by that blessed
name&mdash;&ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> no&mdash;<em>not</em> final;&mdash;else were
this fair earth to us a satisfying birth-right; else had the midnight
stars no eyes of flame to search the guilty conscience; else had the
shimmer of the moonbeam, the ripple of the wave, the crash of the
thunder, the flash of the lightning, the ceaseless moan of the vexed
sea, no voice to waken the never-dying echo of the immortal in our
nature. No&mdash;God be praised&mdash;<em>not</em> final!</p>

<p class="new_para">But we had not intended a homily. To return to the observance of New
Year&#8217;s: for our own taste, we should prefer the sugar, which custom so
lavishly heaps upon New Year&#8217;s cake, spread more sparingly upon our
slices of &ldquo;daily bread;&rdquo; in other words, we should prefer to distribute
the compressed courtesies of our friends on this day, equally, through
the weeks and months of the year. As to the absurd custom of excluding
the daylight, to receive one&#8217;s visitors by the glare of gas, it is a
tacit admission of artificial charms, which one would think even
&ldquo;fashion&rdquo; would be slow to make. The inordinate display of edibles on
such occasions, seems to us as useless as it is disgusting; a cup of
coffee, a slice of cake, or a sandwich, being, in our humble estimation,
sufficient for any gentleman who is able to distinguish between a
private house and a restaurant.</p>

<h2>HAS A MOTHER A RIGHT TO HER CHILDREN?</h2>

<p class="new_para">Most unquestionably, law or no law. Let us begin at the beginning. Let
us take into consideration the physical prostration of mind and body
endured by mothers antecedent to the birth of their offspring; their
extreme nervousness and restlessness, without the ability for
locomotion; the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> nameless horror which hangs over those
who, for the first time, are called upon to endure agonies that no man
living would have fortitude to bear more than once, even at their
shortest period of duration; and which, to those who have passed through
it, is intensified by the vivid recollection (the only verse in the
Bible which I call in question being this&mdash;&ldquo;She remembereth no more
her pains, for joy that a man-child is born into the world&rdquo;). Granted
that the mother&#8217;s life is spared through this terrible ordeal, she rises
from her sick-bed, after weeks of prostration, with the precious burden
in her arms which she carried so long and so patiently beneath her
heart. Oh, the continuous, tireless watching necessary to preserve the
life and limbs of this fragile little thing! At a time, too, of all
times, when the mother most needs relaxation and repose. It is known
only to those who have passed through it. Its reward is with Him who
seeth in secret.</p>

<p class="new_para">I speak now only of <em>good</em> mothers; mothers who deserve the high and
holy name. Mothers who in their unselfish devotion look not at their
capacity to endure, but the duties allotted to them (would that husbands
and fathers did not so often leave it to the tombstone to call their
attention to the former). Mothers, whose fragile hands keep the domestic
treadmill in as unerring motion as if no new care was superadded in the
feeble wail of the new-born infant. Mothers whose work is literally

<em>never</em> done; who sleep with one eye open, intrusting to no
careless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> hireling the precious little life. Mothers who can
scarce secure to themselves five minutes of the morning hours free from
interruption, to ask God&#8217;s help that a feeble, tried woman may hold
evenly the scales of domestic justice amid the conflicting elements of
human needs and human frailties. Now I ask you&mdash;shall any human
law, for any conceivable reason, wrest the child of such a mother from
her frenzied clasp?</p>

<p class="new_para">Shall any human law give into a man&#8217;s hand, though that man be the

wearisome days and sleepless nights, <em>earned</em> this her sweet reward?</p>

<p class="new_para">Shall any virtuous woman, who is in the full possession of her mental

white-winged dove of Peace to sing me a song of heaven. I like to go to
church; it is to me like turning from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> dusty highway of life
into green fields, and, under the friendly shade of some sheltering
tree, gazing, through its leafy canopy, into the serene blue depths
above. The holy hymn soothes me like a mother&#8217;s lullaby to her weary
child. I care not to read the words of the book which custom places in
my hands. I would listen, with closed eyes, while my soul syllables its
own secret burden; floating away on that melody to Him who has given us
this blessed day of rest; and as the last note dies away, I would cross
the sacred threshold, hugging to my heart this holy peace; nor stay to
listen to the cold, theoretical, charnel-house sermons to which, Sunday
after Sunday&mdash;vary the church as I may&mdash;I feel myself, unless
I do this, a disappointed, disheartened, and wearied listener. No
earnestness, no life, no soul; long, dry, windy, wordy
skeleton-discourses; tame platitudes, disgusting rant, a school-boy&#8217;s
parrot-lesson, injudicious depreciation of a world which is sweet to
live in, and fair to see; injudicious denunciation of innocent, youthful
pleasures&mdash;proper and healthful for life&#8217;s young spring-time; an
ascetic rendering of that Blessed Book which is, has been, and will be,
the soul&#8217;s life-boat, spite of its listless and blundering clerical
expositors&mdash;many of whom offer us a Procrustean bed of theology,
too short for any healthy creature of God to stretch himself upon. Who
can wonder at the rebound? Who can wonder that our young people pass by
the church-door, or cross its threshold com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>pulsorily? or that
their decorous seniors enter it but to sleep?</p>

<p class="new_para">A few Sabbaths since I chanced into a church where a hundred and fifty
children were assembled for the afternoon service, to be addressed as
Sunday-school scholars. The out-door air was a luxury to
breathe&mdash;it was one of those lovely spring days, which woo every
living thing to bask in the warm sunshine. These children, many of them
under four, none over fifteen, perspiring in their out-door clothing,
were closely packed in those high-backed, uncomfortable
seats&mdash;their cheeks at fever heat, and every pore in their
crucified bodies crying out for ventilation and common
sense&mdash;neither of which they had for a mortal hour-and-a-half, to
speak within bounds. In vain did teachers frown, and nudge, and
poke&mdash;in vain did the well-meaning but stupidest of possible
ministers pound the pulpit cushions, to impress upon their memories, by
gesticulation, his long-winded sentences; they were all written&mdash;as

a bold assertion. <em>I</em> think not. One hundred and fifty little children
to carry away with them from that church (not only for that afternoon,
but for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> life of Sundays), a disgust of that blessed day,
and what <em>should</em> be its sweet and holy services. But what is the use of
talking? Every great and good cause is sure to be knocked in the head by
some blunderbuss. Why didn&#8217;t that man tell those children some <em>short</em>,
simple story that the youngest child there could understand, appreciate,
and be interested in? Why didn&#8217;t he open wide the church-doors before
their attention and interest flagged? Why so enamored of the sound of
his own voice, as to keep those steaming, par-boiled little victims in
that sacerdotal vapor-bath, after he had said all he could think of to
them, to address their teachers, who, if necessary, should have had a
meeting by themselves for that infliction? And why&mdash;(I ask all of
you who have not forgotten how <em>your</em> restless limbs ached when <em>you</em>
were children)&mdash;must <em>another</em> minister get up after that, and
torture common-sense, and his fainting, frying auditors, by another
aimless, inflated, meaningless, and last-drop-in-the-bucket, but (thanks
to a kind Providence), <em>final</em> address? And why didn&#8217;t somebody seize
the sexton of that church, who had compelled a hundred and fifty
children to breathe the foul air which the morning worshipers had
bequeathed, and which he was too lazy to let out the windows&mdash;why
didn&#8217;t somebody, I say, seize that sexton, and place him in an exhausted
receiver, long enough to give him some <em>faint</em> notion of what he made
those par-boiled children suffer in that &ldquo;protracted meeting?&rdquo;</p>

(written at her own suggestion), marked it with a double row of ink
marks, and laid it in a conspicuous place on the editor&#8217;s
table&mdash;not she. She <em>liked</em> my articles&mdash;liked them so well,
that, on several occasions, she appropriated whole sentences and<span class="pagenum"><a

through forgetfulness), to make the necessary quotation marks! Dove-like

translated (which by the way, her works never have been.) Pious Miss

<h2>KNICKERBOCKER AND TRI-MOUNTAIN.</h2>

<p class="new_para">The New York woman doteth on rainbow hats and dresses, confectionery,
the theater, the opera, and flirtation. She stareth gentlemen in the
street out of countenance, in a way that puzzleth a stranger to decide
the question of her respectability. The New York woman thinketh it
well-bred to criticise <em>in an audible tone</em> the dress and appearance of
every chance lady near her, in the street, shop, ferry-boat, car, or
omnibus. If doubtful of the material of which her dress is composed, she
draweth near, examineth it microscopically, and pronounceth
it&mdash;&ldquo;after all&mdash;silk.&rdquo; The New York woman never appeareth
without a dress-hat and flounces, though the time be nine o&#8217;clock in the
morning, and her destination the grocer&#8217;s, to order some superfine tea.
She delighteth in embroidered petticoats, which she liberally displayeth
to curious bipeds of the opposite sex. She turneth up her nose at a
delaine, wipeth up the pavement with a thousand-dollar silk, and
believeth point-lace collars and handkerchiefs essential to salvation.
She scorneth to ride in an omni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>bus, and if driven by an
impertinent shower therein, sniffeth up her aristocratic nose at the
plebeian occupants, pulleth out her costly gold watch to&mdash;ascertain
the time! and draweth off her gloves to show her diamonds. Arrived at
Snob avenue, she shaketh off the dust of her silken flounces against her
fellow-travelers, trippeth up her aristocratic steps, and holding up her
dress sufficiently high to display to the retreating passengers her
silken hose, and dainty boot, resigneth her parasolette to black John,
and maketh her triumphant exit.</p>

<p class="new_para">At the opera, the New York woman taketh the most conspicuous box,
spreadeth out her flounces to their fullest circumference, and betrayeth
a constant and vulgar consciousness that she is in her
go-to-meetin-fixins, by arranging her bracelets and shawl, settling her
rings, and fiddling at her coiffure, and the lace kerchief on her neck.
She also talketh incessantly during the opera, to show that she is not a
novice to be amused by it; and leaveth with much bustle, just before the
last act, for the same reason, and also to display her toilette.</p>

<p class="new_para">On Sunday morning, the New York woman taketh all the jewelry she can
collect, and in her flashiest silk and bonnet, taketh her velvet-bound,
gilt-clasped prayer-book out for an airing. Arrived at Dives&#8217; church,
she straightway kneeleth and boweth her head; not, as the uninitiated
may suppose, to pray, but privately to arrange her curls; this done, and
raising her head, she sayeth, &ldquo;we beseech thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> to hear us, good
Lord!&rdquo; while she taketh a minute inventory of the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr> Mrs. Peters&#8217;s
Parisian toilette. After church, she taketh a turn or two in Fifth

of way on literary men. She dresseth (to her praise be it spoken)
plainly in the street, and considereth india-rubbers, a straw bonnet, and
a thick shawl, the fittest costume for damp and cloudy weather. She
dresseth her children more for comfort than show, and bringeth them up
also to walk on a crack. She maketh the tour of the Common twice or
three times a day, without regard to the barometer. She goeth to church
twice or three times on Sunday, sandwiched with Bible-classes and
Sabbath-schools. She thinketh London, Vienna, or Paris&mdash;fools to
Boston; and the &ldquo;Boulevards&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tuilleries&rdquo; not to be mentioned with
the Frog Pond and the Common. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> is well posted up as to
politics&mdash;thinketh, &ldquo;as Pa does,&rdquo; and sticketh to it through
thunder and lightning. When asked to take a gentleman&#8217;s arm, she hooketh
the tip of her little finger circumspectly on to his male coat-sleeve.
She is as prim as a bolster, as stiff as a ram-rod, as frigid as an
icicle, and not even matrimony with a New Yorker could thaw her.</p>

daily by his master, to inhale the gutter breezes of Broadway, to excite
the wonder of the curious, and to curl the lips of republicanism. The
New York male hath many and divers garments; some of which he weareth
bob-tailed; some shanghai, some with velvet collars, some with silk;
anon turned up; anon turned down; and some carelessly a-la-flap. The New
York male breakfasteth late, owing to pressing engagements which keep
him abroad after midnight. About twelve the next morning he lighteth a
cigar to assist his blear-eyes to find the way down-town; and with his
hands in his pockets, and arms akimbo, he navigateth tortuously <span class="pagenum"><a

&ldquo;hoops;&rdquo;&mdash;indefatigably pursueth a bonnet for several blocks, to
get a peep it its owner; nor getteth discouraged at intervening
parasols, or impromptu shopping errands; nor thinketh his time or shoe
leather wasted. The New York male belongeth to the most ruinous club and
military company; is a connoisseur in gold sleeve-buttons, and
seal-rings, and diamond studs. He cometh into the world with an
eye-glass and black ribbon winked into his left eye, and prideth himself

first morning I dipped my pen in your sable depths, in the sky-parlor of
that hyena-like Mrs. Griffin? With what an eagle glance she discovered
that my bonnet-ribbon was undeniably guilty of two distinct washings,
and, emboldened by my shilling de laine, and the shabby shoes of little
Nell, inquired &ldquo;if I intended taking in slop-work into <em>her</em>

milk, and wore her under-clothes rough-dry, because she could not afford
to pay for ironing them!&rdquo; Do you remember <em>that</em>, old Ink-stand? And do
you remember the morning she informed me, as you and I were busily
engaged in out first article, that I must &ldquo;come and scrub the stairs
which led up to my room;&rdquo; and when I ventured humbly to mention, that
this was not spoken of in our agreement, do you remember the
Siddons-like air with which she thundered in our astonished

extra dollar in my purse; every rude touch of my little Nell, strength

Ink-stand, look at Nell now! Does any landlady lay rough hands on those
plump shoulders? Dare she sing and run, and jump and play to her heart&#8217;s

dolls, and that globe of gold-fish? Don&#8217;t you feed and clothe her, every
day of her sunshiny life? Haven&#8217;t you agreed to do it, long years to

Righteousness, and though we shall feel after Him, we shall grope like
children in the dark. It is an earthly physician which such as that old
man needs; a tonic for the body, not a sermon from the<span class="pagenum"><a

arm; lead him forth to the green fields, where every little bird sings
God is good; where waving trees and blossoming flowers pass the whisper
round with myriad voices; take away the old man&#8217;s psalm-book, and let
him listen to that anthem, and as the soft breath of spring lifts his
white locks from his troubled brow, the film of disease will fall from
his eyes, and he, too, shall sing that God is <em>good</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Every body knows that young girls are foreordained to go through a
regular experience in eating slate-pencils, burnt quills, pickles, and
chalk; but this green age passed, one looks for a little common sense. I
have often seen New York women, not content with ruining their own
constitution in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> way (and consequently periling their
prospective offspring), buy, before leaving the confectioner&#8217;s shop,
five or six pounds of candy for <em>nursery distribution</em>, and ask Betty,
the next day (the sapient mother!), &ldquo;what can ail those children to fret
so?&rdquo; It were more merciful to purchase a dose of strychnine, and put an
immediate end to their misery, than thus murder them by inches. Are the
rosy, robust, beautiful English children, candy-fed? Are they suffered
to gorge themselves on hot bread, preserves, cake and pastry, <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
libitum</span></em>? Do they have any thing but the plainest puddings, the stalest
bread, and the most unmitigated roast and boiled meat, unpoisoned by
those dyspepsia-breeding gravies of ours?</p>

<p class="new_para">It is pitiful, this dwarfing of American children with improper food,
want of exercise, and cork-screw clothes. It is inhuman to require of
their enfeebled minds and bodies, in ill-ventilated schoolrooms, tasks
which the most vigorous child should never have imposed upon his tender
years. As if a child&#8217;s physique were not of the first
importance!&mdash;as if all the learning in the world could be put to
any practical use by an enfeebled body! As if a parent <em>had a right</em>,
year after year, thus to murder the innocents.</p>

<p class="new_para">Think of one of those candy-and-cake-fed young girls, bending over her
tasks in school, from nine o&#8217;clock till three, with perhaps ten or
fifteen minutes intermission (spent in the close air of the
school-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>room) and two days out of a week at three, after another
ten minutes&#8217; intermission, and another cake-and-candy feed, commencing
drawing, or music lessons, to last till five; her mother, meanwhile,
rocking away as comfortably, in her chair at home, as if her daughter&#8217;s
spine were not crooking irretrievably. I will not speak of the utter
impossibility that this young girl should have a <em>steady hand</em> for
drawing, under such circumstances, because any fool can understand that
to be impossible.</p>

<p class="new_para">I ask what <em>right</em> have you to require of your child, your growing,
restless child, what it would be impossible for you to do yourself? You
know very well that you could not keep your mind on the stretch for so
many hours to any profit; or your body in one position for such a length
of time, without excessive pain and untold weariness. Then add to this
the tasks which must be conned on the return home for the next day&#8217;s
lesson, and one marvels no longer at the sickly, sallow, narrow-chested,
leaden-eyed young girls we are in the habit of meeting.</p>

<p class="new_para">What <em>would</em> I have? I would have teachers less selfishly consult their
own convenience, in insisting upon squeezing into the forenoon what
should be divided between forenoon and afternoon, as in the good
old-fashioned way of keeping school, with time to eat a wholesome dinner
between. A teacher&#8217;s established constitution may possibly stand this
modern nonsense (though I am told not long); but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> that

<em>children</em> should be thus victimized, without at least a remonstrance on
the part of their natural guardians, I can only ascribe to the criminal
indifference of parents to the welfare of their offspring.</p>

<h2>LADY DOCTORS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">And so the female doctors are prospering and getting practice. I am sure
I am heartily glad of it, for several reasons; one of which is, that it
is an honest and honorable deliverance from the everlasting,
non-remunerating, consumptive-provoking, monotonous needle. Another is,
that it is a more excellent way of support, than by the mercenary and
un-retraceable road, through the church-door to the altar, into which so
many non-reliant women are driven. Having said this I feel at liberty to
remark that we all have our little fancies, and one of mine is, that a
hat is a pleasanter object of contemplation in a sick-room than a
bonnet. I think, too, that my wrist reposes more comfortably in a big
hand than a little one, and if my mouth is to be inspected, I prefer
submitting it to a beard than to a flounce. Still, this may be a narrow
prejudice&mdash;I dare say it is&mdash;but like most of my prejudices, I
am afraid no amount of fire will burn it out of me.</p>

<p class="new_para">A female doctor! Great Esculapius! Before swallowing her pills (of which
she would be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> first), I should want to make sure that I had
never come between her and a lover, or a new bonnet, or been the
innocent recipient of a gracious smile from her husband. If I desired
her undivided attention to my case, I should first remove the
looking-glass, and if a consultation seemed advisable, I should wish to
arm myself with a gridiron, or a darning-needle, or some other
appropriate weapon, before expressing such a wish. If my female doctor
recommended a blister on my head, I should strongly doubt its necessity
if my hair happened to be handsome, also the expediency of a
scar-defacing plaster for my neck, if it happened to be plump and white.
Still, these may be little prejudices; very like they are; but this I
will say, before the breath is taken out of me by any female doctor,
that while I am in my senses I will never exchange my gentlemanly,
soft-voiced, soft-stepping, experienced, intelligent, handsome doctor,
for all the female M. D.&#8217;s who ever carved up dead bodies or live
characters&mdash;or tore each other&#8217;s caps.</p>

<h2>FANNY FORD.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="new_para">It was a mad freak of dame Nature to fashion Mary Ford after so dainty a
model, and then open her blue eyes in a tumble-down house in Peck-lane.
But Mary cares little for that. Fortune has given her wheel a whirl
since then, and Jacob Ford is now on the top. Mary sees the young and
the old, the grave and the gay, the wise and the ignorant, smile on her
sweet face; as she passes, men murmur &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; and women pick flaws
in her face and figure. She can not sleep for serenades, and her little
room is perfumed, from May to January, with the rarest of hot-house
flowers. Lovers, too, come wooing by the score. And yet, Mary is no
coquette; no more than the sweet flower, which nods, and sways, and
sends forth its perfume for very joy that it blossoms in the bright
sunshine, all unconscious how it tempts the passer-by to pluck it for
his own wearing. A queenly girl was the tailor&#8217;s daughter, with her
Juno-like figure, her small, well-shaped head, poised so daintily on the
fair white throat; with her large blue eyes, by turns brilliant as the
lightning&#8217;s flash, then soft as a moonbeam; with her pretty mouth, and
the dimple which lay <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdu</span></em> in the corner, with the flossy waves of her
dark brown hair; with her soft, white hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> twinkling
little feet; with her winsome smile, and floating grace of motion.</p>

<p class="new_para">Percy Lee was conquered. Percy&mdash;who had withstood blue eyes and
black, gray eyes and hazel. Percy&mdash;for whom many a fair girl had
smiled and pouted in vain. Percy the bookworm. Percy&mdash;handsome as
Apollo, cold as Mont Blanc. Percy Lee was fettered at last, and right
merrily did mischievous Cupid forge, one by one, his chains for the
stoic. No poor fish ever so writhed and twisted on the hook, till the
little word was whispered which made him in lover&#8217;s parlance, &ldquo;the
happiest of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Of course, distanced competitors wondered what Mary Ford could see to
admire in that book-worm of a Percy. Of course, managing mammas, with
marriageable daughters, were shocked that Miss Ford should have angled
for him so transparently; and the young ladies themselves marveled that
the aristocratic Percy should fancy a tailor&#8217;s daughter; of course the
lovers, in the seventh heaven of their felicity, could afford to let
them think and say what they pleased.</p>

<p class="new_para">The torpid sexagenarian, or frigid egotist, may sneer; but how beautiful
is this measureless first love, before distrust has chilled, or
selfishness blighted, or the scorching sun of worldliness evaporated the
heart&#8217;s dew; when we trust with childhood&#8217;s sweet faith, because we
love; when care and sorrow are undiscernible shapes in the
distance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> when at every footstep we ring the chime of joy from
out the flowers. What can earth offer after this sparkling draught has
been quaffed? How stale its after spiritless effervescences!</p>

<p class="new_para">Percy&#8217;s love for Mary was all the more pure and intense, that he had
hitherto kept his heart free from youthful entanglements. Fastidious and
refined to a degree, perhaps this with him was as much a matter of
necessity as of choice. In Mary both his heart and taste were satisfied;
true, he sometimes wondered how so delicate and dainty a flower should
have blossomed from out so rude a soil; for her father&#8217;s money could
neither obliterate nor gild over the traces of his innate vulgarity; in
fact, his love for his daughter was his only redeeming trait&mdash;the
only common ground upon which the father and lover could meet. The petty
accumulation of fortune by the penny, had narrowed and hardened a heart
originally good and unselfish; the love of gold for its own sake had
swallowed up every other thought and feeling. Like many persons of
humble origin, whose intellects have not expanded with their coffers,
Jacob Ford overrated the accident of birth and position, and hence was
well pleased with Mary&#8217;s projected alliance with Percy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, to be sure, Lucy, beauty <em>is</em> a great thing for a girl,&rdquo; he one
day said to his wife. &ldquo;I did not dream of this when Mary used to climb
up on the counter of my little dark shop in Peck-lane, and sit playing
with the goose and shears.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; replied Lucy, as she looked around their handsome apartment,
with a satisfied smile; &ldquo;nor I, Jacob, when, after paying me one
Saturday night for my week&#8217;s work, you said, &lsquo;Lucy, you can be mistress
of this shop if you like.&rsquo; I was <em>so</em> proud and happy: for, indeed, it
was lonesome enough, Jacob, stitching in that gloomy old garret I often
used to think how dreadful it would be to be sick and die there alone,
as poor Hetty Carr did. It was a pity, Jacob, you did not pay her more,
and she so weakly, too. Often she would sit up all night, sewing, with
that dreadful cough racking her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;wife,&rdquo; said Jacob; &ldquo;she was not much of a
seamstress; you always had a soft heart, Lucy, and were easily imposed
upon by a whining story.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It was too true, Jacob; and she had been dead a whole day before any
one found it out; then, as she had no friends, she was buried at the
expense of the city, and the coffin they brought was too short for her,
and they crowded her poor thin limbs into it, and carried her away in
the poor&#8217;s hearse. Sometimes, Jacob, I get very gloomy when I think of
this, and look upon our own beautiful darling; and, sometimes,
Jacob&mdash;you won&#8217;t be angry with me?&rdquo; asked the good woman,
coaxingly, as she laid her hand upon his arm&mdash;&ldquo;sometimes I&#8217;ve
thought our money would never do us any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; exclaimed Jacob, impatiently shaking off his wife&#8217;s hand;
&ldquo;pshaw, Lucy, you are like all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> other women, weak and
superstitious. A man must look out for number one. Small profits a body
would make to conduct business on your principles. Grab all you can,
keep all you get, is every body&#8217;s motto; why should I set up to be wiser
than my neighbors?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Lucy Ford sighed. A wife is very apt to be convinced by her husband&#8217;s
reasoning, if she loves him; and perhaps Lucy might have been, had she
not herself known what it was to sit stitching day after day in her
garret, till her young brain reeled, and her heart grew faint and sick,
or lain in her little bed, too weary even to sleep, listening to the
dull rain as it pattered on the skylight, and wishing she were dead.</p>

<p class="new_para">A pressure of soft lips upon her forehead, and a merry laugh, musical as
the ringing of silver bells, roused Lucy from her reverie.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Good-by&mdash;mother dear,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;I could not go to ride with
Percy without a kiss from you. Come to the window&mdash;look! Are not
those pretty horses of Percy&#8217;s? They skim the ground like birds! And see
what a pretty carriage! Now acknowledge that my lover&#8217;s taste is
perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;when he chose you,&rdquo; said Jacob, gazing admiringly on Mary&#8217;s
bright face and graceful form. &ldquo;You would grace a court, Mary, if you
are old Jacob Ford&#8217;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mary threw her arms around the old man&#8217;s neck, and kissed his bronze
cheek. To her the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> father was another name for love;
nurtured in this kindly atmosphere, she could as little comprehend how a
child could cease to worship a parent, as she could comprehend how a
parent, when his child asked for bread, should mock his misery with a
stone. Unspoiled by the world&#8217;s flatteries, she had not learned to
undervalue her doting father&#8217;s love, that it was expressed in
ungrammatical phrase; she had not yet learned to blush at any
old-fashioned breach of etiquette (on his part), in the presence of her
fastidious young friends; and by her marked deference to her parents in
their presence, she in a measure exacted the same from them. It was one
of the loveliest traits in Mary&#8217;s character, and one for which Percy,
who appreciated her refinement, loved and respected her the more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Have your fortune told, lady?&rdquo; asked a withered old woman, of Mary, as
she tripped down the steps to join Percy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the laughing girl: &ldquo;suppose you tell me whom I am to
marry,&rdquo; with a gay glance at Percy; and she ungloved her small white
hand, while the dame&#8217;s withered fingers traced its delicate lines.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Retribution is written here,&rdquo; said the old woman, solemnly; &ldquo;your sun
will set early, fair girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Come away, Mary,&rdquo; said Percy, with a frown, shaking his whip at the
woman, &ldquo;the old thing is becrazed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; muttered the beldame, pocketing the coin with which
Mary had crossed her hand; &ldquo;time will show; brighter eyes than yours,
fair lady, have wept themselves dim.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;What can she mean?&rdquo; said Mary, drawing involuntarily close to the side
of her lover. &ldquo;I almost wish we had not seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The spirits of youth are elastic. The April cloud soon passed from
Mary&#8217;s brow, and before the fleet horses had skimmed a mile, her laugh
rang out as merrily as ever.</p>

<p class="new_para">The lovers had both a trained eye for natural beauty, and the lovely
road through which they passed, with its brown houses half hidden in
foliage&mdash;the lazy grazing cattle&mdash;the scent of new-mown hay
and breath of flowers&mdash;the rude song of the plowman and the
delicate twitter of the bird&mdash;the far-off hills, with their tall
trees distinctly defined against the clear blue sky&mdash;the silver
stream and velvet meadows&mdash;the wind&#8217;s wild anthem, now swelling as
if in full chorus, then soft and sweet as the murmur of a sleeping babe,
all filled their hearts with a quiet joy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Life is very sweet,&rdquo; said Mary, turning her lustrous eyes upon her
lover. &ldquo;People say that happiness and prosperity harden the heart; when
I am most blest I feel most devotional. In vain might the infidel tell
me &lsquo;there is no God,&rsquo; with such a scene as this before me, or fetter my
grateful heart-pulses as they adored the Giver.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You dear little saint,&rdquo; said Percy, with a light laugh, &ldquo;how well you
preach. Well&mdash;my mother was neck-deep in religion; the prayers and
hymns she taught me, stay by me now, whether I will or no. I often catch
myself saying &lsquo;Now I lay me,&rsquo; when I go to bed, from the mere force of
habit; but your rosy lips were never made to mumble pater nosters, Mary:
leave that to crafty priests, and disappointed nuns. Religion, my pet,
is another name for humbug, all the world over; your would-be-saint
always cheats in proportion to the length of his face and his prayers.
Bah! don&#8217;t let us talk of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Don&#8217;t&mdash;dear Percy,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I like you less well when you talk
so; religion is the only sure basis of character. Every superstructure
not built on this foundation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Must topple over, I suppose,&rdquo; said Percy. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you believe it, my
angel. I am a living example to the contrary; but Cupid knows I would
subscribe to any article of faith emanating from your rosy lips;&rdquo; and
Percy drew rein at the door of his father-in-law&#8217;s mansion, and leaping
out, assisted Mary to alight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Such a lovely drive as we have had, dear mother,&rdquo; said Mary, throwing
her hat upon the table. &ldquo;Percy has just gone off with a client on
business; he will be back presently. Dear Percy! he&#8217;s just the best
fellow in the world&mdash;a little lax on religious points, but he loves
me well enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> be influenced there. Now I will sit down at
this window while I sew, and then I shall see Percy when he comes up the
street.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Nimbly her fingers moved; her merry song keeping time the while. Now a
blush flitting over her cheek, then a smile dimpling it. She was
thinking of their beautiful home that <em>was</em> to be, and how like a fairy
dream her life would pass, with that deep, rich voice lingering ever in
her ear; cares, if they came, lightened by each other&#8217;s presence, or
turned to joys by mutual sympathy. And then, she was so <em>proud</em> of him;
A woman&#8217;s love is so deepened by that thought.</p>

<p class="new_para">God pity her, who, with a great soul, indissolubly bound, must walk ever
backward with a mantle (alas! all too transparent), to cover her
husband&#8217;s mental nakedness!</p>

<p class="new_para">Jacob sprang to his feet, and seizing Lucy by the arm, hissed in her

forever damned. Lucy&mdash;Percy Lee is a&mdash;a&mdash;swindler!
There&mdash;now go break <em>her</em> heart, if you can.
Lucy?&mdash;Trask?&rdquo;&mdash;and Jacob, overcome with the violence of his
feelings, wept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> again like a child; while poor Lucy, good Lucy,
hid her face on her husband&#8217;s breast, repressing her own anguish that

her husband&#8217;s breast, and moved toward the door.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Percy Lee a defaulter&mdash;a swindler! The news flew like wildfire.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No great catch, after all,&rdquo; said a rival beauty, tossing her ringlets.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I expected something of that sort,&rdquo; said a modern Solomon.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Hope he&#8217;ll be imprisoned for life,&rdquo; said a charitable tailor, whom
Jacob Ford had eclipsed, &ldquo;this will bring Jacob&#8217;s pride down a trifle,
I&#8217;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;How lucky you did not succeed in catching him,&rdquo; said a mother,
confidentially, to her daughter.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I?&rdquo; exclaimed the young lady. &ldquo;I? Is it possible you can be so stupid,
mamma, as to suppose I would waste a thought on Percy Lee! I assure you
he offered himself to Mary Ford in a fit of pique at my rejection. Don&#8217;t
imagine you are in all my secrets,&rdquo; said the dutiful young lady, tossing
her head. &ldquo;Well&mdash;her disappearance from society is
certain&mdash;thank goodness&mdash;not that she interferes with <em>me</em>;
but her pretended simplicity is so disgusting! What the men in our set
could see to admire in her, passes me; but <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chacun à son gout</span></em>.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Of course, Lee will get clear,&rdquo; said a rough dray-man to his comrade.
&ldquo;These big fish always flounder out of the net; it is only the minnows
who get caught. Satan! it makes me swear to think of it.<span class="pagenum"><a

I hope the aristocratic hound will swing for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Come, now, Jo,&rdquo; said his friend, taking out his penknife, and sitting
down on a stump to whittle. &ldquo;You are always a railing at the
aristocracy, as you call &#8217;em. I never knew a man who talks as you do,
who was not an aristocrat at heart, worshiping the very wealth and
station he sneered at. Don&#8217;t be a fool, John. We are far happier, or
might be, with our teams, plenty of jobs, and good health, than these
aristocrats, as you call them, who half the time are tossing on their
pillows, because this ship hasn&#8217;t arrived in port, or that land
speculation has burst up, or stocks depreciated, or some such cursed
canker at the root of all their gourds. Now there&#8217;s poor Jacob Ford; of
what use are all his riches, now his daughter&#8217;s heart is broke? And
Percy Lee, too&mdash;will his fine education and book learning get him
out of the clutches of the law? Have a little charity, Jo. It hurts a
man worse to fall from such a height into a prison, than it would you or
me, from a dray-cart. Gad&mdash;I pity him; his worst enemy couldn&#8217;t
pile up the agony any higher.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Pity him!&rdquo; said Jo, mockingly&mdash;&ldquo;a swindling rascal like
that&mdash;to break a pretty girl&#8217;s heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Jo,&rdquo; said his friend, shutting up his penknife, and looking him
steadily in the eye, &ldquo;have you always said no to the tempting devil in

<em>your</em> heart? Did you never charge a stranger more than the law<span class="pagenum"><a

girl ever curse the hour she saw the light, for your sake?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Parson, what if all that were true?&rdquo; asked Jo, with an
abortive attempt at a laugh. &ldquo;I can&#8217;t see what it has to do with what we
are talking about; hang it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; answered his friend. &ldquo;He who is without sin, only, is to
cast the first stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;O, get out,&rdquo; said Jo, cracking his whip over his horse&#8217;s head, and
taking refuge, like many other cornered disputants, in flight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">And Percy Lee! From the hour in which he passed from the heaven of
Mary&#8217;s smile, up to the present moment, in which he paced like a caged
lion up and down his narrow bounds, what untold agonies were his! Why
had he wrecked happiness, love, honor, all in one fatal moment? Why had
he prostituted his God-given talents so madly to sin? Let those answer
who have in like manner sinned, and who have expiated that sin, by a
life-long brand upon the brow and a life-long misery in the heart. &ldquo;Let

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I can&#8217;t remember,&rdquo; said Mary, two months after Percy&#8217;s arrest, &ldquo;I can&#8217;t
remember,&rdquo; raising herself, and laying her emaciated hand upon her brow.
&ldquo;Have I been sick, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, Mary,&rdquo; replied her mother, repressing her tears of joy at the

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Where&#8217;s Percy, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">But before Lucy could answer, she again relapsed into stupor. Another
hour passed&mdash;there was reason in her glance. &ldquo;Mamma?
Percy&mdash;take me to him&rdquo;&mdash;said Mary, with a burst of tears, as
she strove vainly to rise from her couch.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;By-and-by, darling,&rdquo; said her mother, coaxingly, laying her gently back
upon the pillow, as she would an infant, &ldquo;by-and-by, Mary, when you are
stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No&mdash;<em>now</em>&rdquo; she replied, a spasm of pain contracting her features.
&ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he&mdash;<em>there</em>? How long have I lain here?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Two months, Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Two months,&rdquo; exclaimed poor Mary, in terror, &ldquo;two months. O, mamma, if
you ever loved me, if you want me to live&mdash;take me to him. Two
months! He will think!&mdash;O, dear, mamma, take me to Percy!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, you <em>shall</em> go,&rdquo; said Jacob, &ldquo;only don&#8217;t cry. I would

that curs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well&mdash;well, I won&#8217;t say it,&rdquo; said the old man, kissing her
forehead; &ldquo;but mind, it is only for <em>your</em> sake&mdash;here&mdash;Lucy,
quick, she is fainting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Another week passed by, poor Mary making superhuman efforts to sit up,
to gain strength to accomplish her heart&#8217;s wish. Jacob would look at
her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> wasted figure, till the curse rose to his lip, and then
rush suddenly from her presence.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I did not think I could do this, even for her,&rdquo; muttered Jacob, on the
morning of their visit to the prison. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what has come over
me, Lucy&mdash;sometimes I wonder if I <em>am</em> Jacob. I don&#8217;t care for any
thing, so she don&#8217;t grieve.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The carriage came&mdash;in silence the sad trio moved toward the prison.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Can&#8217;t do it,&rdquo; whispered Jacob to Lucy, as they stopped before the door;
&ldquo;I thought I could go in with her; but I can&#8217;t do it, not even for Mary.
The old feeling has come back. I can&#8217;t look on that man&#8217;s face without
crushing him as I would a viper;&rdquo; and the old man left them in the
turnkey&#8217;s office, returned to the carriage, twitched down the blinds,
and threw himself back upon the seat.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah! how much the poor heart may bear! Mary sat in the prison
office&mdash;still&mdash;motionless!&mdash;but a bright spot burned upon
her cheek, and her tone was fearful in its calmness, and Lucy asked her
again &ldquo;if she were strong enough to go through with it.&rdquo; How distinctly
the turnkey&#8217;s clock ticked! What a quantity of false keys and other
implements which had been taken from refractory prisoners, were on
exhibition in the glass case! How the clerk stared at them as they
registered their names in the book! What a mockery for that little bird
to sing in his cage, over Mary&#8217;s head! How crushed and broken-hearted
the poor woman looked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> the black bonnet, on the bench,
waiting to see her prodigal son! How sad his young wife beside her, with
the unconscious baby sleeping on her breast! The room grew
smaller&mdash;the air grew stifled.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You can go now, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; said the turnkey, rattling his keys and
addressing Lucy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;In a moment, please,&rdquo; said Lucy, with a quivering lip, as Mary fell
from her chair:&mdash;&ldquo;Some water quick, please, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and she
untied the strings of Mary&#8217;s hat.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mary, after a pause. And again the bright spot burned upon
her cheek&mdash;and as with faltering step, she followed the turnkey,
the young wife&#8217;s tears fell on her baby&#8217;s face, while she murmured, &ldquo;God
help her, and it&#8217;s my own heart that has the misery, too.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="new_para">The huge key grated in the lock. In the further corner of the cell,
crouched Percy&mdash;his chin in his palms, his eyes bloodshot, and his
face livid as death.</p>

<p class="new_para">As Mary tottered through the door, Percy raised his head, and, with a
stifled groan, fell at her feet. Pressing his lips to the hem of her
robe, he waved her off with one hand, as if his touch were
contamination. Mary&#8217;s arms were thrown about his neck, and the words, &ldquo;I
love you,&rdquo; fell upon his doomed ear, like the far-off music of heaven.
When Percy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> would have spoken, Mary laid her hand upon his
mouth&mdash;not even to <em>her</em>, should he humiliate himself by
confession. And so, in tears and silence, the allotted hour
passed&mdash;He only, who made the heart, with its power to enjoy or
suffer, knew with what agonizing intensity.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;ve seen a great many pitiful sights in my day,&rdquo; said the old
jailor, as the carriage rolled away with Mary; &ldquo;but never any thing that
made my eyes water like the sight of that poor young cretur. Sometimes I
think there ain&#8217;t no justice up above there, when I see the innocent
punished that way with the guilty. I hope these things will all be made
square in the other world; I can&#8217;t say they are clear to my mind here. I
get good pay here, but I&#8217;d rather scull a raft than stay here to have my
feelin&#8217;s hurt all the time this way. If I didn&#8217;t go in so strong for
justice, I should be tempted, when I think of that young woman, to
forget to lock that fellow&#8217;s cell some night. &lsquo;Five years&#8217; hard labor!&rsquo;

<em>&#8217;Tis</em> tough, for a gentleman born&mdash;well, supposing he got out? if
he is a limb of the devil, as some folks say, he will break her heart
over again some day or other. It would be a shorter agony to let her
weep herself dead at once. God help her.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="new_para">The Bluff Hill penitentiary was called &ldquo;a model prison.&rdquo; A &ldquo;modern
Howard&rdquo; was said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> planned it, and passed his oracular
judgment, ratified by the authorities of the State in which it was
located, upon its cells, prison-yards, work-shops, chapel, eating-rooms,
and ingenious instruments of torture.</p>

<p class="new_para">That the furnaces failed to keep the prisoners from freezing in winter,
or that there was no proper ventilation in summer, was, therefore,
nobody&#8217;s meddling business. Better that <em>they</em> should suffer, year in
and year out, than that a flaw should be publicly picked in any scheme
set afoot by the &ldquo;modern Howard.&rdquo; The officers elected to preside over
Bluff Hill prison, were as stony as its walls, and showed curious
visitors round the work-shops, amid its rows of pallid faces, pointing
out here a disgraced clergyman, there a ruined lawyer, yonder a wrecked
merchant, with as much nonchalance as a brutal keeper would stir up the
caged beasts in a menagerie, for the amusement of the crowd; with as
little thought that these fallen beings were <em>men</em> and brothers, as if
the Omniscient eye noted no dark stain of sin, hidden from human sight,
on <em>their</em> souls.</p>

<p class="new_para">They gave you leave to stop as long as you pleased, and watch the
muscles of your victim&#8217;s face, work with emotion under your gaze. You
could take your own time to speculate upon the scowl of defiance, or the
set teeth of hate, as you flaunted leisurely past their prison uniform,
in your silk and broadcloth; or you could stand under the fair blue sky,
in the prison-yard, when the roll beat for dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> and see them
in file, by twos&mdash;guarded&mdash;march with locked step and folded
arms, to their eating-room. The beardless boy branded in your
remembering eye for life, wherever you might hereafter meet him, for
this his first crime, how hard soever against fearful odds, he might
struggle upward to virtue and heaven. You might follow the sad
procession to thair meals, where the fat, comfortably-fed chaplain
craved a blessing over food, from which the very dog at his door would
have turned hungry away; or you could go into the prison hospital, and
view the accommodation (?) for the sick&mdash;the cots so narrow that a
man could not turn in them; or you could investigate &ldquo;The Douche,&rdquo; which
the keeper would tell you, with a bland smile, &ldquo;conquered even old
prison birds;&rdquo; or you could peep into the cells (philanthropically
furnished by this &ldquo;modern Howard&rdquo; with a Bible), so dark that at the
brightest noonday no prisoner could read a syllable; or you could see
the row of coffins standing on an end in the hall, kept on hand &ldquo;for
sudden emergencies;&rdquo; or any other horrors of the place, for which your
morbid curiosity was appetized.</p>

<p class="new_para">Or, if you had a human heart beating within your breast, if you could
remember ever kneeling to ask forgiveness of your God, you could turn
away soul-sick from such unfeeling exhibitions, and refuse to insult
their misery&mdash;fallen as they were&mdash;by your curious gaze. You
could remember in your own experience, moments of fearful temptation,
when the hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> blood poured like molten lead through <em>your</em>
veins. You could place in the balance, as God does&mdash;as man does
not&mdash;neglected childhood&mdash;undisciplined youth. You could
remember, that at a kindly word, whispered in those felon cars, the
hardest rock might melt; and you could wish that if prisons must be,
they who pass under their iron portals might pass unrecognizable in
after life by the world&#8217;s stony eyes&mdash;you could wish that when
freedom&#8217;s air again fanned their pallid temples, no cursed scornful
finger might lash to fury the hydra-headed monster Sin, in their scarred
hearts.</p>

<p class="new_para">Heaven speed the day when the legislative heart, pitiful as God&#8217;s, shall
temper this sword of justice with more mercy.</p>

and high forehead&mdash;that&#8217;s he&mdash;see? reefing off flax yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Don&#8217;t say,&rdquo; said the man, with his bloated eyes gloating over Percy.
&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Nineteen only,&rdquo; said the keeper.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the man, loud enough for Percy to

spirit,&rdquo; said Mr. Scraggs, as Percy answered the keeper&#8217;s question
without raising his eyes. &ldquo;Bah! how these fuzzy bits of lint and flax
fly about the room; my throat and nose are full. I should think this
would kill a fellow off before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said the keeper, coolly.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;And what&#8217;s that horrible smell? Faugh&mdash;it makes me sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That? Oh, that&#8217;s the oil used in the machinery.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Why the fury don&#8217;t you ventilate, then?&rdquo; asked Mr. Scraggs,
thinking more of his <em>own</em> lungs than the prisoners&#8217;, adding, with a
laugh, as he recollected himself, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t suppose the Governor of your
State is particular on <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Closing quotation
mark added">that p&#8217;int;&rdquo;</span> then, with another stare at Percy, he said,
&ldquo;they say he seduced old Ford&#8217;s daughter before he stole the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The words had hardly left his lips, when, with a bound like a panther,
Percy instantly felled him to the earth, the blood spouting from his own
mouth and nostrils with the violence of his passion.</p>

<p class="new_para">Scraggs lay for some hours insensible, though not dangerously wounded,
and Percy was led off in irons, to reflect on this new misery in
solitary confinement.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I stepped in to inquire after poor Mary, this morning,&rdquo; said a neighbor
of Lucy Ford. &ldquo;Poor dear! she&#8217;s to be pitied!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">They who have suffered from the world&#8217;s malice, know that the most
simple words may be made to convey an insult, by the tone in which they
are uttered. Lucy Ford was naturally unsuspicious, but there was
something in Miss Snip&#8217;s tone which grated harshly on her ear.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I regret to say Mary is no better,&rdquo; Lucy replied, with her usual gentle
manner. &ldquo;If I could persuade her to take more nourishment, I should be
glad; but she sits rocking to and fro, seemingly unconscious of every
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I should like to see the poor dear,&rdquo; said Miss Snip.</p>

<p class="new_para">Lucy hesitated; then blushing, as if she felt ashamed of her doubts, she
led the way to Mary&#8217;s room. Every thing about it bore marks of the taste
of the occupant. There lay her silent guitar; there a half finished
drawing; here a book with the pearl folder still <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Originally &ldquo;betwen&rdquo;">between</span> the leaves,
where she and Percy had left it. The beautiful tea-rose he had given
her, drooped its buds in the window, for want of care, and the canary&#8217;s
cage was muffled, lest its song should quicken painful memories. And
there sat Mary, as her mother had said, rocking herself to and fro, with
her hands crossed listlessly on her lap, her blue-veined temples growing
each day more startlingly transparent.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Quite heart-rending, I declare,&rdquo; said Miss Snip, &ldquo;and as if the poor
dear hadn&#8217;t enough to bear, just think of the malice of people. I said
it was a shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> and that of course nobody would believe it of
Miss Mary, and I never spoke of it, except to lawyer Beadle&#8217;s wife, and
one or two of our set; but a rumor is a rumor, and when it is once set
rolling, it has got to go to the bottom of the hill; but nobody, I&#8217;m
sure, that ever knew Miss Mary, would believe she would be seduced by
Percy Lee!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Lord-a-mercy! you don&#8217;t suppose she heard me?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Snip, as
Mary fell forward upon the floor.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Cursed viper!&rdquo; shouted Jacob Ford, emerging from the ante-room, and
unceremoniously ejecting Miss Snip through the door. &ldquo;Cursed viper!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That&#8217;s what I call pretty treatment, now,&rdquo; muttered Miss Snip, as she
stopped in the hall, to settle her false curls; &ldquo;very pretty
treatment&mdash;for a disinterested act of neighborly kindness.
Philanthropy never is rewarded with any thing but cuffs in this world,
but I shan&#8217;t allow it to discourage me. I know that I have my mission
here below, whether I have the praise of men or not. All great reformers
are abused&mdash;that&#8217;s one consolation. I&#8217;ll step over to Mrs. Bunce&#8217;s
now, and see if it <em>is</em> true that her husband takes a drop too much.
They <em>do</em> say so, but I don&#8217;t believe a word of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; said Jacob&mdash;and the poor old man&#8217;s limbs shook beneath
him&mdash;&ldquo;this must be the last arrow in the quiver. Nothing can come
after this. Let her be, Lucy,&rdquo;&mdash;and he withdrew his wife&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a

temples&mdash;&ldquo;let her be: &#8217;tain&#8217;t no use to rouse her up to her
misery&mdash;to kill her by inches this way. I am ready to lie down side

blow came, that we are beggars. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t no matter now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;God be merciful!&rdquo; said Lucy, overwhelmed with this swift accumulation
of trouble.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, you may well say that. Just enough left to keep us from starving.
My heart has been with <em>her</em>, you see,&rdquo; said Jacob, looking at Mary,
&ldquo;and my head hasn&#8217;t been clear about things, as it used to be, and so it
has come to this. I wouldn&#8217;t mind it, if she only&mdash;&rdquo; and Jacob
dropped his head hopelessly upon his breast. Then raising it again, and
wiping his eyes, as he looked at Mary, he said: &ldquo;She never will look
more like an angel than she does now. I thought she&#8217;d live to close
these old eyes, and that my grand-children would play about my knee, but
you see how it has gone, Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">The red flag of the auctioneer, so often the signal of distress, floated
before Jacob Ford&#8217;s door. Strange feet roved over the old house; strange
eyes profaned the household gods. Careless fingers tested the quality of
Mary&#8217;s harp and guitar; and voices which in sunnier days had echoed
through those halls in blandest tones, now fell upon the ear, poisonous
with cold malice. When once the pursuit is started, and the game
scented, every hound joins in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> the cry; each fierce paw must
have its clutch at the quivering heart, each greedy tongue lap up the
ebbing life-blood. Never was beauty&#8217;s crown worn more winningly, more
unobtrusively, less triumphantly, than by Mary Ford; but to those whom
nature had less favored, it was the sin never to be forgiven; and so
fair lips <em>hoped</em> the stories were not true about her, while they
reiterated them at every street corner; and bosom friends, when inquired
of as to their truth, rolled up their eyes, sighed like a pair of
bellows, and with a deprecating wave of the hand, replied, in melancholy
tones, &ldquo;don&#8217;t ask <em>me</em>,&rdquo; thus throwing the responsibility upon the
listener to construe it into little or much; pantomimic looks and
gestures not yet having been pronounced indictable by the statute book;
others simply nodded their heads, in a mysterious manner, as if they had
it at their charitable option to send the whole family to perdition,
with a monosyllable.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Jacob Ford&#8217;s new home was a little cottage, just on the outskirts of the
city; for Lucy said, &ldquo;maybe the flowers, and the little birds, and the
green grass might tempt Mary out of doors, where the wind might fan her
pale cheek.&rdquo; It was beautiful to see Lucy stifling her own sorrow, while
she moved about, performing uncomplainingly the household drudgery. Mary
would sit at the window, twisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> her curls idly over her
fingers, or leaning out, as if watching for Percy. Sometimes she would
sit on the low door-step, when the stars came out, with her head in
Jacob&#8217;s lap, while his wrinkled fingers strayed soothingly over her
temples. She seldom or never spoke; did mechanically what she was bid,
except that she drew shuddering back, when they would have led her
across the threshold. Once she wept when Jacob brought her a violet,
which he found under the cottage window. Jacob said, &ldquo;dear heart! why
should a little blossom make the poor thing cry?&rdquo; Lucy&#8217;s womanly heart
better solved the riddle: it was Percy&#8217;s favorite flower.</p>

<p class="new_para">Their rustic neighbors leaned over each other&#8217;s fences, and wondered
&ldquo;who on airth them Fords was,&rdquo; and why &ldquo;the old man didn&#8217;t take no
interest in fixin&#8217; his lot. The trees wanted grafting, the grass wanted
mowing, the gooseberries were all over mildew, the strawberries, choked
with weeds; and it did really &#8217;pear to them as though the old fellow
must be &#8217;ither a consarned fool, or an idiot, to let things run out that
way. And the poor sick girl, she looked like a water-lily&mdash;so
white, so bowed down; why didn&#8217;t they put her into a shay, and drive her
out, to bring a little color into her waxen cheeks?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The thrifty housewives said, &ldquo;it was clear to them that the old lady
hadn&#8217;t <em>her</em> wits, narry more than the old man, for she left her
clothes&#8217;-line out all night, when every body knew that dew and
rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> would rot it; but what could you expect from shiftless
city folks?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">For all this the country people were kind-hearted. New neighbors did not
grow on every bush. Topics were scarce in Milltown, and every new one
was hunted down like a stray plum in a boarding-school pudding. Yes, you
might have gone further, and found worse people than the Milltown-ites.
The little sun-burnt children learned to loiter on their way to school,
&ldquo;to pick a nosegay for the pretty pale lady.&rdquo; Widow Ellis, under the
hill, picked her biggest strawberries, and put them in a tempting little
basket, covered with green leaves, for her curly-pated Tommy to carry to
&ldquo;poor Miss Mary.&rdquo; Miss Trodchom baked an extra loaf of &#8217;lection-cake,
&ldquo;in hopes the Fords&#8217; daughter might nibble a bit, poor thing.&rdquo; And
farmer Jolly dropped his whip on purpose, over Jacob&#8217;s fence, to get a
chance to tell the old man &ldquo;that he had a mare as was as easy as a
cradle, and a prettyish side-saddle that the sick girl might have, and
welcome, if she took a notion.&rdquo; And Mr. Parish, the minister, came, but
he could not make much of Jacob, who told him &ldquo;that if it was religion
to be willing to see one&#8217;s own flesh and blood suffer, he did not want
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor old Jacob! Every earthly reed had broken beneath him, his unsteady
steps were tottering toward the grave, and yet he threw aside the only
sure Staff. He did not know, poor old man, so gradually had his heart
hardened by contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> the world, &ldquo;that it is easier for a
camel to go through a needle&#8217;s eye than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God.&rdquo; Through no rift in the dark cloud which shadowed him,
could he see bright Mercy&#8217;s sunbeam. One by one the lights had gone out
in his sky, and still he groped about, blind to the rays of Bethlehem&#8217;s
star. Poor old Jacob!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">It was Sabbath morning. Jacob stood at his cottage door, gazing out.
Each tiny blade of grass bent quivering under its glistening dew-drop.
The little ground-birds on the gravel walk were picking up their early
breakfast; the robins were singing overhead. The little swallows flew
twittering round the cottage eaves. The leaves were rustling with their
mysterious music. The silver mist wreathed playfully over the
hill-sides, whose summits lay bathed in sunshine. Every thing seemed
full of joyous life. Where was the Master hand which regulated all that
harmony? The birds sang&mdash;the leaves danced&mdash;the brooks
sparkled&mdash;the bee hummed&mdash;why did He make <em>man</em> only to
suffer? It was all a riddle to poor Jacob. He took his staff, and
sauntered away under the drooping lindens. The Sabbath bell was calling
the simple villagers to church. Across the meadows, down the grassy
lane&mdash;the rosy maiden, the bent old man, and the lisping little
child. Jacob looked after them as they went. Jacob never had been to
church&mdash;not since he was a little child. Sunday he always posted
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> books, squared up his accounts, wrote business letters and
the like of that; shortening the day at both ends by getting up later
and going to bed earlier. Sunday to him was no different from any other
day in the week&mdash;except that he transferred his business from his
counting-room to his parlor; and yet&mdash;here he was, leaning on his
staff, before the village church, almost wishing to go in with its
humble people. He looked about as if he expected somebody to be
astonished that Jacob Ford should be standing so near a church door; but
nobody seemed to notice it, or look at all surprised. By-and-by he crept
on a little further, and seated himself on a stone bench in the porch,
with his chin upon his staff. The butterfly and the bee passed in and
out; even the little birds flew in at the church door, and out at the
open window; and still old Jacob sat there&mdash;he could scarcely have
told why. Now he hears the choir sing,</p>

<p class="new_para">As the song died away, old Jacob&#8217;s tears flowed down his cheeks; the

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Come unto me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Old Jacob took his staff, and tottered out into the little church-yard
He did not know he was praying, when his soul cried out, &ldquo;Lord help me;&rdquo;
but still his lips kept murmuring it, as he passed down the grassy road,
and under the drooping lindens, for each time he said it, his heart
seemed to grow lighter; each time it seemed easier for old Jacob to
&ldquo;come.&rdquo; And so he entered his low doorway, and as he stooped to kiss his
daughter&#8217;s cheek, the bitterness seemed to have gone from out his heart,
and he felt that he could forgive even Percy, for His sake of whom he
had just so recently craved forgiveness.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Lucy, awed by the strange expression of Jacob&#8217;s
face, and laying her hand tenderly upon his arm; &ldquo;what is it, Jacob?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; whispered the old man, reverently; &ldquo;God&#8217;s peace&mdash;here
Lucy;&rdquo; and he laid his hand on his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Lucy took old Jacob&#8217;s staff and set it in the corner. Good, kind Lucy!
She did not think when she did so, that he would need it no more. She
did not know when the sun went down that night, that death&#8217;s dark shadow
fell across her cottage threshold. She did not know, poor Lucy, when she
slumbered away the night hours so peacefully by his side, that, leaning
on a surer Staff, old Jacob had passed triumphantly through the dark
valley; and when at length the little twittering sparrows woke her with
their morning song, and she looked into the old man&#8217;s cold, still face,
the pale lips, though they moved not, seemed to whisper, &ldquo;Peace,
Lucy&mdash;God&#8217;s peace.&rdquo;</p>

never does any good no how&mdash;the boy is good enough by
natur&#8217;&mdash;good as you was, I dare say, when you was his age. I
wouldn&#8217;t give a cent for a boy that hain&#8217;t no friskiness about him, no

allers scolding, just as you say. It&#8217;s &lsquo;John, go weed those parsnips;
ten to one, you careless dog, you&#8217;ll pull up the parsnips instead of the
weeds;&rsquo;&mdash;or, &lsquo;John, go carry that corn to mill; ten to one, you&#8217;ll

discourage any lad, such a constant growling and pecking; now I want my
boys to love me when they grow up. I don&#8217;t want them glad to see the old
man&#8217;s back turned. I don&#8217;t want them happier any where than at their own

way the village tavern thrives. I tell you, Pike, if you lace up natur
too tight, she&#8217;ll bust out somewhere. Better draw it mild.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;O, don&#8217;t talk to me, neighbor,&rdquo; said Rice, impatiently. &ldquo;Them&#8217;s modern
notions; thrash children, I say. When I was a lad, if I did my duty, it
was well; if I didn&#8217;t, I knew what to expect. It is well enough for your
children to love you; of course they oughter, when you&#8217;ve brought them
into the world; but I say they&#8217;ve got to mind, <em>any</em> how; &lsquo;obey your

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said farmer Rice, &ldquo;I believe in that; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> there&#8217;s
another verse in the same book, that runs this way&mdash;&lsquo;Parents
provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well&mdash;well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pike, uneasily, &ldquo;I hate argufying, as I do
bad cider. Your neighbor, Mr. Ford, dropped off sudden like, didn&#8217;t he?
What&#8217;s the matter of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Some say one thing&mdash;some another; but I think, neighbor, it was
just here. That ere old man has been in harness these sixty
years&mdash;it was a sort of second natur to him to be <em>active</em>. Well,
he was taken right out of the whirl and hubbub of the city, where people
can&#8217;t hardly stop long enough to bury one another, and sot right down in
this quiet place, where there&#8217;s nothing a-going but frogs and crickets,
with nothing to do but to brood over his troubles. Well, you see such a
somerset at his time o&#8217; life wan&#8217;t the thing; of course it upsot him.
He&#8217;d lean over this fence, and lean over that, and put on his hat, and
take it off, and walk a bit, and sit down a bit, and act just like an
old rat in a trap, trying to gnaw his way out. It was just as if you
should pull up that old oak-tree, that has grown in that spot till its
roots strike out half a mile round, and set it out in some foreign sile;
it wouldn&#8217;t thrive&mdash;of course not.&rdquo;</p>

cracking his horse-whip at a happy little vagrant robin, as he went
through the gate and down the road.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Summer had danced by&mdash;the chill wind whistled through the
trees&mdash;the nuts were dropping in showers, and the leaves rusted
beneath the traveler&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> foot; the golden-rod and barberry
clusters alone remained to deck the hedges, and the striped snake
crawled out on the rock to sun himself only at midday. Widow Ford&#8217;s
cottage looked lonely and desolate, stripped of its leafy screen; but
the squirrels might be seen leaping from tree to tree as merrily as if
old Jacob still sat watching them in the door-way. Lucy moved about,
sweeping, dusting, replenishing the fire&mdash;but the silver hair
glistened on her temples, and her step was slow and weary. Now and then
she would lean against the mantel, and look at Mary&mdash;and then
wander restlessly into the little bedroom&mdash;then, back again to the
mantel.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You still think it best to consummate this marriage?&rdquo; said the clergyman
to Lucy, in a low voice.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Only that I would not leave her alone,&rdquo; said Lucy, tremulously. &ldquo;I
shall soon be in the church-yard by the side of Jacob. Mr. Shaw knows
all&mdash;he loves her, and wishes to make her his wife. I believe he
will be kind to her. As for Mary, poor thing, you see how it is,&rdquo; and
she glanced at her daughter, who sat with locked fingers&mdash;her long
lashes sweeping her colorless cheek. One might have taken her for some
beautiful statue, with those faultless marble features, and that
motionless attitude.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Parish sighed, as he looked at Mary; but he had little time to
discuss matters, if that were his intention, for the sound of
approaching carriage-wheels announced Mr. Shaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;At twelve, then, to-morrow,&rdquo; said he, as he took up his hat, &ldquo;if you
are of the same mind, I will perform the ceremony as you desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Parish walked home in a very thoughtful mood. Through his
acquaintances in the city, he had learned the history of the family. He
knew the length and breadth of the shadow which had fallen across their
hearth-stone. He saw that it was true, as Lucy had said, that her own
strength was fast failing; still it seemed to him sacrilege to bestow
Mary&#8217;s hand in marriage, when her heart was so benumbed and dead. He
would have offered her a shelter in his own house, had he been master of
it; but, unfortunately, he had married a lady who lost no opportunity to
remind him that her dowry of twenty thousand dollars was payment in full
for the total abnegation of his free will. This was not the first
occasion on which the clanking of this gentleman&#8217;s golden fetters had
sounded unmusically in his reverend ears; in truth, he would much have

by farming, as did the neighboring country clergy. Mrs. Parish lost no
opportunity to remind her husband that he was sold, by such pleasant
remarks as the following: That it was time <em>her</em> house was re-painted,
or <em>her</em> barn re-roofed, or <em>her</em> carry-all re-cushioned. When she felt

<em>unusually</em> hymeneal, she would say, &ldquo;Mr. Parish, you can use <em>my</em>
horses to-day, if you will <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Closing

deferred to her husband&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> opinion in company, was no proof of
the absence of a private conjugal understanding, that he was to consider
himself merely her echo.</p>

<p class="new_para">Little did his brother clergymen who exchanged with him in their
thread-bare suits of black, dream of the price at which his pleasant
parsonage surroundings were purchased. Little did they dream, when they
innocently brought along their wives and babies on such occasions, the
suffering it entailed on &ldquo;brother Parish.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">No, poor simple souls, they went home charmed with the hospitality of
their host and hostess, charmed with their conjugal happiness, and
marveling as they returned to their own houses, what made their rooms

Had they been clairvoyantly endowed, they might have seen brother
Parish, after he had smilingly bowed them down the nicely rolled gravel
walk to their wagons, return meekly to the parlor, to be reminded for
the hundredth time, by Mrs. Parish, of that twenty thousand dollar
obligation. Well might personal feelings come in, to strengthen his
ministerial scruples, lest he should join carelessly in wedlock, hands
which death only could unclasp.</p>

while Mrs. Jones stood with her arms a-kimbo, in the doorway,
ejaculating: &ldquo;Zekiel Jones and my Louizy&mdash;a fellow who goes to

all Greek to me. Confound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> it, I feel as if I were in a nest of

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Not she, the delicious little monkey; she tossed her pretty head, and
said with an arch smile: &lsquo;Mark what I say: he&#8217;ll be back to me in six
months.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Pretty prophet!&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>

<p class="new_para">The two young men locked arms and sauntered down the crowded street,
whiffing their cigars; now attracted by some brilliant shop-window, now
bandying jests with those miserable women, who, but for just such as
they, might have lifted their womanly brows to the starry sky&mdash;pure
as when first kissed by a mother&#8217;s loving lips. Pale seamstresses glided
by, unguarded, save by Him who noticeth the sparrow&#8217;s fall. Young men of
their own age, weary of the slowly accumulating gains of honest toil,
looked enviously upon their delicately kidded hands, fine apparel, and
care-for-naught air. Passing, at length, the long line of carriages in
front of the opera house, they disappeared under the lighted vestibule,
and took possession of one of the boxes.</p>

<p class="new_para">Fair young girls were there, unveiling to the libidinous eye, at
Fashion&#8217;s bidding, charms of which they should have been chary to the
moon. Faded belles throwing out bait at which nobody even nibbled.
Married men groaned, looked at their watches, and leaning back in their
seats, computed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> the rise and fall of stocks; married women
gazed anxiously around to see if their laces, diamonds, or cashmeres
were eclipsed by their neighbors&#8217;. Every body was bored to death,
stifled by the heat, blinded, by the gas, and scientifically
inappreciative of the music, but every body willing to endure ten times
as much, rather than not be &ldquo;in the fashion.&rdquo; The moon, to be sure,
silvered the pretty fountain in the park, close by, and the cool, sweet
evening breeze played through the blossoming trees; but the &ldquo;working
people&rdquo; were stretched upon its benches; the poor man&#8217;s child laid his
soft cheek to the cool grass; the ragged little urchin, escaping from
the stifled air of the noisome lane, threw up his brimless hat in the
gravel walk. The parks were plebeian, opera boxes were beyond the reach
of &ldquo;the vulgar.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">But look! Now the audience show signs of animation. All is astir. See,
the ballet! A fleecy cloud sails in, enveloping &ldquo;Susy.&rdquo; Susy, the

dimpled shoulders. Susy, with her pretty ankles and rounded waist. Susy,
with her jeweled arms and rose-banded hair. Susy, with her rounded bosom
and twinkling feet. Young men and old men level their glasses in
breathless admiration, as Susy languishingly twirls, and tip-toes, and
pirouettes. Young girls, who have long since ceased blushing at such
exhibitions, wish, for the nonce, that <em>they</em> were Susy, as bouquets and

<span class="i0">She slumbered in undreaming night.&rdquo;<br /></span></div>

<p class="new_para">Life and death had passed each other on the threshold! Lucy Ford&#8217;s tears
were the baptism of Mary&#8217;s motherless babe. The poor weary heart, whose
pulse had beat so unevenly above it, had ceased its flutterings. It was
nothing new to see Mary lie with marble face, folded hands, and
softly-fringed, closed eyes. But, <em>sometimes</em>, the thin hand had been
kindly outstretched toward Lucy; <em>sometimes</em>, the glossy head had raised
itself, and leaned tenderly on the maternal bosom; <em>sometimes</em>, the blue
eye had lingered lovingly on her wrinkled face. Small comfort, God
knows&mdash;and yet it was much to poor Lucy. She looked at the little
gasping, helpless thing before her&mdash;a tenant already for her rifled
heart&mdash;a new claimant for her love and care. Oh, how could she else
but welcome it? With soft folds she wrapped its fragile limbs, with
motherly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> care she soothed it on her sunken breast, and with a
prayer to God, as she pressed her lips to Mary&#8217;s brow, she promised
Death to be faithful to the trust of Life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">Days and nights&mdash;weeks, months and years came and went, blanching
the prisoner&#8217;s lip and cheek, but failing to subdue a love which yet had
not saved him from incurring a doom so terrible. Had Mary forgotten him?
for, since that dreadful, happy day, when he clasped her in his cell, he
had heard nothing save the damning sneer of the villain Scraggs. Perhaps
she was dead&mdash;and his bloodless lip quivered at the thought.
Nay&mdash;worse&mdash;perhaps they might have married her, in her
despair, to another. Percy tossed on his narrow cot in agony.</p>

<p class="new_para">He even welcomed the day-light, which recalled him to his task. Oh,
those long, long nights, when locked in his cell, remorse kept him
silent company! or worse, the dreary, idle Sunday, when taken out once
to chapel, then remanded back to his dark cell, he lay thinking of the
pleasant Sabbaths he had passed with Mary, in the little parlor, on the
sofa by her side. He could see her now, in the pretty blue dress she
wore to please him; the ring he had given her, sparkling on her white
hand&mdash;her glossy hair, worn the very way <em>he</em> liked to see it, the
book opened at the passage <em>he</em> liked best, the little flower pressed
between its leaves, because <em>he</em> gave it. Then the little arbor in the
garden&mdash;where they used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> sit the pleasant Sabbath
evenings&mdash;the song Mary sang him there&mdash;with her head upon his
breast. Oh, happiness&mdash;oh, misery!</p>

<p class="new_para">Percy knew it was summer, for as he passed through the prison-yard he
saw that the green blades of grass were struggling up between the
flag-stones, and now and then, he heard the chirp of a passing bird. The
sky, too, was softly blue, and the breeze had been where clover and
daisies had bloomed, and rifled their sweetness.</p>

<p class="new_para">Percy looked down on his shrunken limbs, clad in his felon
garb&mdash;then on his toil-worn hands. He passed them slowly over his
shaven crown. Merciful Heaven! he&mdash;Percy Lee&mdash;Mary&#8217;s lover!
Fool&mdash;thrice-accursed fool;
life&mdash;liberty&mdash;happiness&mdash;love&mdash;all laid at the feet
of the tempting fiend&mdash;for this! No tears relieved the fierce fire,
which seemed consuming his heart and brain. How long could he bear this?
Was his cell to be his grave? Once, seized with a sudden illness, he had
been taken to the prison hospital, where the doctor tried pleasant
little experiments on the subjects who came under his notice. Around him
were poor wretches, groaning under every phase of bodily and mental
discomfort. Now roused out of some Heaven-sent slumber, when it suited
the doctor to show them to visitors; or to descant upon the commencement
and probable duration of their disease, coupled with accounts of
patients who had died in those beds, and whom he <em>could</em> have cured
under different circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">It was here that Percy shed the only tears which had moistened his eyes
since his incarceration. A party of visitors were passing through the
wards, listening to the doctor&#8217;s egotistical details, and peeping into
the different cots. A sweet little girl had strayed away from the rest
of her party, and was making her tour of childish observation alone. Her
eye fell upon Percy. She stood for a moment, gazing at him with the
intensest pity written on her sweet face. Then gliding up to his side,
she drooped her bright curls over his pillow, and placing a flower
between his fingers, she whispered, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll pray to God to make you well
and let you go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Mary! come here,&rdquo; said a shrill female voice, recalling the child;
&ldquo;don&#8217;t you know that is a horrid bad man! he might kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No, he is not,&rdquo; said the little creature, confidently, with a piteous
glance of her soft, blue eyes at Percy; &ldquo;no, he is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; asked one of the party.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; replied the child; &ldquo;something tells me so&mdash;here;&rdquo;
and she laid her hand on her breast.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you please let him go home?&rdquo; asked she of the doctor.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>Home.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">As the sweet pleader passed out, the room seemed to grow suddenly dark,
and Percy turned his face to his pillow, and wept aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Heavenly childhood! that the world should ever chill thy Christ-like
heart. That scorn should uproot pity. That suspicion should stifle love.
That selfishness should dry up thy tears, and avarice lock thine open
palm, with its vice-like grasp! Oh, weep not ye who straighten childhood
for the grave; over whose household idols the green grass waves;
heaven&#8217;s bright rain showers and spring flowers bloom. Let the bird
soar, while his song is sweetest, before one stain soil his plumage, or
with maimed wing he flutter helplessly. Let him soar. The cloud which
hides him from thy straining eye, doth it not hide him from the archer?</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;The top o&#8217; the mornin&#8217; to yez, Bridget,&rdquo; said Pat, poking his head into

<p class="new_para">Bridget&#8217;s prediction was not long being verified. Upholsterers were soon
in attendance, re-modeling and re-furnishing poor Mary&#8217;s apartments, of
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> the pretty <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></em> shortly took unblushing and
triumphant possession. It was understood in the house, that her will was
to be law; and implicit obedience to the same the surest passport to
head-quarters. Poor Lucy, willing to bear any thing rather than
separation from the child&mdash;chased from one room to
another&mdash;finally took refuge with her charge in the attic, whither
poor Mary&#8217;s portrait had long since been banished. For the little
Fanny&#8217;s sake, she patiently endured every humiliation; she heeded not
the careless insolence of the new <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></em> of servants. She bore every
caprice of the tyrannical little <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></em>. Patiently her feeble limbs
tottered up stairs and down, performing the offices of nurse and servant
to her grandchild; patiently she soothed it when ill, or amused it when
fretful; uncomplainingly she bore from her son-in-law his maudling
curses, when they passed each other on the stairs, or in the hall. Every
thing&mdash;any thing, but separation from Mary&#8217;s child, which nestled
every day closer to her heart; and whose soft eyes and glossy curls
reminded her every day more forcibly of her lost daughter. Every day she
prayed to God to spare the withered trunk till the vine which clambered
round it should gather strength to brave the winds and storms. Fanny
slept securely on her breast, while the bacchanalian song resounded
through the house, and obscene jests, and curses loud and deep, made
night hideous. And when the moonbeams penetrated the little window,
and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> falling upon Mary&#8217;s portrait, revealed her in all her
beauty, before the shadow had fallen on her fair brow, or dimmed her
lustrous eyes, or robbed that dimpled mouth of its sunny smile, poor
Lucy would nestle closer to little Fanny, and pray God that so bitter a
cup might pass from <em>her</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Dear little Fanny! with her plump little arms thrown carelessly over her
curly head, her pearly teeth just gleaming through her parted lips, as
if some kind angel even then were promising her exemption from such a
doom.</p>

<p class="new_para">Time crept on, blanching Lucy&#8217;s cheek to deadly paleness, tinting
Fanny&#8217;s with a lovelier rose; thinning Lucy&#8217;s silver hair, piling the
golden clusters round Fanny&#8217;s ivory brow; bending Lucy&#8217;s shrunken limbs,
rounding Fanny&#8217;s into symmetry and grace.</p>

<p class="new_para">True, the child never left the attic; but what place, how circumscribed
soever, will not Love beautify and brighten? True, &ldquo;mamma&#8217;s&rdquo; pictured
semblance responded not to the little upturned face and lisping lips,
but who shall say that age and infancy were the <em>only</em> tenants of that
lonely room?</p>

<p class="new_para">Fanny knew that she had a &ldquo;papa&rdquo; somewhere in the house, but &ldquo;papa&rdquo; was
always &ldquo;sick,&rdquo; or &ldquo;busy,&rdquo; so grandmamma said; that must be the reason
why he never came up to see his little girl. Sometimes Fanny amused
herself by climbing up to the little window, overlooking the square
where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> silvery fountain tossed its sparkling diamonds to the
sun, who turned them all sorts of pretty colors, and sent them quivering
back again. Little Fanny liked that! Then she saw little children
playing round the fountain, sailing their tiny boats on its bosom, and
clapping their hands gleefully when they rode safely into port. Great
shaggy Newfoundland dogs, too, jumped into the water, and swam, with
their black noses just above the surface, and ever and anon sprang out
upon the mossy bank, shaking their shaggy coats upon the more dainty
ones of mamma&#8217;s little pets, quite regardless of lace, silk, or ribbon.
It was a pretty sight, and little Fanny wanted to go to the fountain
too; but grandmamma was so feeble, and she had so much running to do up
and down stairs, that she had no strength left to walk; and then
grandmamma had to make all Fanny&#8217;s little dresses, and keep them tidy
and nice; and by the time the sun moved off of mamma&#8217;s picture in the
afternoon, she was quite ready to go to bed with little Fanny.</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor old grandmamma! Fanny handed her her spectacles, and a cricket to
put her poor tired feet upon, and picked up the spools of cotton when
they rolled upon the floor, and learned too to thread her needles quite
nicely, for grandmamma&#8217;s eyes were getting dim; and sometimes Fanny
would try to make the bed, but her hand was so tiny that she could not
even cover one of the small roses of its patch-work quilt. Dear little
thing! He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> blessed little children, recorded of her, &ldquo;She
hath done what she could.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">One day Fanny heard a great noise&mdash;a great bumping and tumbling, as
if some heavy body were falling down the stairs. Then she heard a deep
groan&mdash;and then <em>such</em> a shriek! If she lived to be as old as
grandma, that shriek would never go out of her ears; then there was a
great running to and fro, Patrick and Bridget wrung their hands, and
said ochone! ochone! and then grandmamma&#8217;s face grew very white, as she
took Fanny by the hand and hurried down stairs; and when they got into
the lower entry, there lay a gentleman very still on the floor. A
beautiful lady was kneeling on the floor beside him, chafing his
temples&mdash;but it was of no use; feeling of his pulse&mdash;but it
was quite still. Then the beautiful lady shrieked again&mdash;oh, so
dreadfully! and then she fell beside him like one dead.</p>

<p class="new_para">Fanny&#8217;s grandma whispered to her, that the gentleman &ldquo;was her papa,&rdquo; and
that he had fallen down stairs and broken his neck&mdash;grandma did not
say that he was drunk when he did it. Fanny crept up to him, for she had
wanted so much to see her papa&mdash;so she put her little rosy face
close to his, and said, &ldquo;Wake up, please, papa, and see me.&rdquo; But he did
not open his eyes at all; then she put her hand on his face, and then
she seemed frightened&mdash;her little lip quivered, and she clung to
her grandmoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>er&#8217;s dress&mdash;then some men came and carried
papa up stairs, and the maid-servants laid the beautiful lady on the
sofa, in the parlor; and she and grandma went back up into the
attic&mdash;and all that day, grandma did not seem to see mamma&#8217;s
picture at all; and when Fanny came up to her, she wept and said, &ldquo;God
help you&mdash;my poor lamb.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="new_para">The bell sounded at Bluff Hill Prison, to call the prisoners to their
tasks. They passed out from their cells and crossed, two by two, the
prison-yard to their workshops. Percy and a stout negro were the last
couple in the file. Just as they were about passing in, the African, who
had received the punishment of the douche the day previous, for
dilatoriness at his task, sprang upon the officer in waiting, and seized
him by the throat. Percy, whose pugilistic science was a match for the
African&#8217;s muscle, grappled with and secured him in an instant,
receiving, as he did so, a severe bite from the fellow&#8217;s teeth, in his
left shoulder. The negro was handcuffed, and Percy carried to the
hospital, to have his wound dressed. The officer, in the flush of his
gratitude, assured him, as he left, that the case should be laid before
the governor, and would undoubtedly result in his pardon.</p>

<p class="new_para">Percy&#8217;s eye brightened, as he bowed his head in reply, but in truth he
took no credit for the deed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> it was only following an
irresistible impulse to save the life of a fellow-creature.</p>

<p class="new_para">Liberty! it would be sweet! But, pshaw! why dream of it? Men were
proverbially ungrateful. Ten to one, the officer would never think of
his promise again; or if he did, the governor would lay it on the table,
to be indefinitely postponed, or forgotten, or rejected, with a thousand
other troublesome applications. No&mdash;suns would rise and set just as
they had done, and time for him would be marked only by the prison-bell,
with its clanging summons to labor. He should see, every day, as he had
done, the poor lame prisoner sunning himself in his favorite corner in
the yard&mdash;he should see the prisoners&#8217; mattresses, hung on the
rails to air&mdash;he should see the gleam of the blacksmith&#8217;s forge,
and hear the stroke of the stonecutter&#8217;s hammer; the shuttle would fly,
and the wheel turn round. He should sit down to his wooden plate, his
square bit of salt meat, and his one potato, and drink water out of his
rusty tin cup. He should gasp out the starry nights in his stifling
cell; he should hear the rustling of silken robes, as ladies went the
prison rounds, and his heart would beat quick as he thought of Mary; he
should burn forever with the fire of remorse and shame&mdash;yet never
consume; the taper would flicker and flicker&mdash;yet never go out.</p>

<p class="new_para">So Percy sat carelessly down on the hospital bench, to have his wound
dressed; and listened to the asthmatic breathing of the sick man at his
side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> and saw the hospital cook stirring in a cauldron some
diluted broth, and watched the doctor, as he compounded a plaster, and
leisurely smoked a cigar; and looked at a green branch which the wind
ever and anon swept across the grated window, showering its snowy
blossoms, as if in mockery, on the prison floor.</p>

<p class="new_para">O, no&mdash;liberty was not for him&mdash;and why should it be? Had he
not forfeited it by his own rash act?&mdash;was not his punishment
just?&mdash;had he not lost the confidence of his fellow
men?&mdash;crushed the noblest and purest heart that ever God warmed
into life and love? It was all too true, and there had been moments when
he meekly accepted his punishment, when he toiled in his prison uniform,
not as if under the eye of a taskmaster, but willingly, almost
cheerfully, as if by expiatory penance he could atone to himself for the
wrong he had done that guileless heart. O, did it still beat? and for
him? for the thousandth time he questioned. Could Mary look on him?
smile on him? <em>love</em> him still? O, what mockery were liberty else! What
mattered it how brightly the sun shone, if it shone not on their love
purified and intensified by sorrow? What matter how green the earth, if
they walked not through it side by side? What mattered it how fresh the
breeze&mdash;how blue the sky&mdash;how soft the moonbeams&mdash;how
sweet the flowers&mdash;how bright the stars&mdash;if day and night
found not their twin hearts beating like one? Better his cell should be
his tomb.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I like to live here,&rdquo; said little Fanny, running up to Lucy, with her
sun-bonnet hanging at the back of her neck; her cheeks glowing, and her
apron full of acorns, pebbles, pine leaves, grasses and flowers; &ldquo;see
here, I tied them up with a blade of grass for you, and here&#8217;s a white
clover; a great bumble bee wanted it, he buzzed and buzzed, but I ran
off with it; won&#8217;t you go with me, grandmother, and help me find a
four-leaved clover? Don&#8217;t sew any more on those old vests. Who taught
you to make vests?&rdquo; asked the little chatterbox.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;O, I learned many&mdash;many&mdash;years ago,&rdquo; replied Lucy, with a
sigh, as she thought of Jacob; &ldquo;and now you see, dear, what a good thing
it is to learn something useful when one is young. If I did not know how
to make these vests, I could not pay for this room we live in, you know;
here, thread my needle, darling, either the eye is too small, or my eye
is too dim; I can&#8217;t see as well as I used.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I wish I could do something useful,&rdquo; said Fanny, as she handed back the
needle. &ldquo;I can only brush up the hearth, and fill the tea-kettle, and
pick up your spools, and thread your needle, and&mdash;what else,
grandma?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Make this lonely old heart glad, my darling,&rdquo; said Lucy, pressing her
lips to Fanny&#8217;s forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t my papa ever come kiss me?&rdquo; asked Fanny. &ldquo;Was I too naughty
for my papa to love?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No&mdash;no, my darling,&rdquo; said Lucy, turning away her head to restrain
her tears, &ldquo;you are the best little girl that&mdash;but run away,
Fanny,&rdquo; said she, fearing to trust herself to speak. &ldquo;Go find grandma a
pretty four-leaved clover.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The child sprang up and bounded toward the door. Standing poised on one
foot on the threshold, with her little neck bending forward, she
exclaimed eagerly, &ldquo;Oh, grandma, I dare not; there&#8217;s a man climbing over
the stile into the meadow, with a pack on his back; won&#8217;t he hurt me?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lucy, peering over her spectacles at the man, and then
resuming her seat, &ldquo;it is only a peddler, Fanny; shops are scarce in the
country, so they go round with tapes, needles, and things, to sell the
farmers&#8217; wives. I am glad he has come, for I want some more sewing-silk
to make these button-holes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Good day, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; said the peddler, unlading his pack. &ldquo;Would you like
to buy any thing to-day?
Combs&mdash;collars&mdash;needles&mdash;pins&mdash;tapes&mdash;ribbons&mdash;laces?
buy any thing to-day, ma&#8217;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;May I look?&rdquo; whispered Fanny to Lucy, attracted by the bright show in
the box.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;There&#8217;s a ribbon for your hair,&rdquo; said the peddler, touching her curls
caressingly; &ldquo;and here is a string<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> of beads for your neck. You
will let me give them to you, won&#8217;t you? because I have no little girl
to love;&rdquo; and his voice trembled slightly.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;May I love him, grandma?&rdquo; whispered Fanny, for there was something in
the peddler&#8217;s voice that brought tears into her eyes. &ldquo;May I give him
some milk to drink, and a piece of bread?&rdquo; and hardly waiting for an
answer, she flew to the cupboard, and returned with her simple lunch.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the peddler, in a low voice, without raising his eyes.</p>

<p class="new_para">The sewing-silk was purchased, and the box rearranged, and strapped up,
but still the peddler lingered. Lucy, thinking he might be weary,
invited him to stop and rest awhile.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I will sit here on the door-step awhile, if you please, with the little
girl,&rdquo; said the peddler. &ldquo;Are you fond of flowers?&rdquo; said he to Fanny,
again touching her shining curls.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;only I don&#8217;t like to go alone to get
them&mdash;the cows stare at me so with their great big eyes, and the
little toads hop over my feet, and I am afraid they will bite; they
won&#8217;t bite, will they?&rdquo; asked Fanny, looking confidingly up in his face.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I should not think any thing could harm <em>you</em>,&rdquo; replied the peddler,
drawing his fingers across his eyes.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;What are you crying for?&rdquo; asked Fanny, &ldquo;&#8217;cause you haven&#8217;t any little
girl to love you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;The dust, dear, in the road, quite blinded me to-day,&rdquo; replied the
peddler.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I will bring you some water for them, in my little cup,&rdquo; said Fanny.
&ldquo;Grandma bathes her eyes when they ache, sewing on those tiresome
vests.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No&mdash;no&rdquo;&mdash;said the peddler, catching her by the hand as she
sprang up&mdash;&ldquo;don&#8217;t go away&mdash;sit down&mdash;here&mdash;close by
me&mdash;I will make a wreath of flowers for your hair; your eyes are as
blue as this violet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;They are mamma&#8217;s eyes,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;Grandma calls them &lsquo;mamma&#8217;s eyes.&rsquo;
We have a pretty picture of mamma&mdash;see&mdash;that&#8217;s it,&rdquo; and she
bounded across the room and drew aside a calico curtain which screened
it. &ldquo;There, isn&#8217;t it pretty?&mdash;why don&#8217;t you look?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The peddler slowly turned his head, and replied, in a husky voice, &ldquo;Yes,
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Mamma is dead,&rdquo; said Fanny, re-seating herself by his side. &ldquo;What makes
you shiver? are you cold?&mdash;he is sick, grandma,&rdquo; said Fanny,
running up to Lucy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;A touch of my old enemy, the ague, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; said the peddler,
respectfully&mdash;and Lucy returned to her needle.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes, my mamma is dead,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;Are you sorry my mamma is dead?
Sometimes I talk to her&mdash;grandma likes to have me; but mamma&#8217;s
picture never speaks back. Don&#8217;t you wish my mamma would speak back?&rdquo;
said Fanny, looking up earnestly in his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">The peddler nodded&mdash;bending lower over the wreath he was twining.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;My papa is dead, too,&rdquo; said Fanny&mdash;&ldquo;are you sorry my papa is dead?
Nobody loves me but grandma and God.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;And I&rdquo;&mdash;said the peddler, touching her curls again with his
fingers.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Why do you keep touching my hair?&rdquo; asked the little chatterbox.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Because it is so like&mdash;oh, well&mdash;I am sure I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo;
said the peddler, placing the wreath over her bright face, and touching
his lips to her forehead. &ldquo;Good-by, dear, don&#8217;t forget me. I will make
you a prettier wreath sometime, shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;let me tell grandma. Grandma is so deaf she can&#8217;t
hear us;&rdquo; and the child ran back into the room to tell the news.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I like peddlers,&rdquo; said little Fanny, as she watched her new friend
saunter slowly down the road. &ldquo;He gave me this pretty wreath and this
ribbon; I am sorry he didn&#8217;t like mamma&#8217;s picture; he hardly looked at
it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;The peddler never heard of your mamma, my darling; you must not expect
strangers to feel as you and grandma do about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fanny, in a disappointed tone;&mdash;&ldquo;but it is a pity,
because I like him. There he goes; now he has climbed the fence, and is
crossing the meadow. Good by, Mr. Peddler.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Yes&mdash;across the meadow, down the little grassy lane, over the
stile&mdash;far into the dim&mdash;dim woods, where no human eye could
penetrate, prostrate upon the earth, shedding such tears as manhood
seldom sheds, lay the peddler. Still in his ears lingered that bird-like
voice, still in his veins thrilled the touch of that tiny hand, and
those silken curls, in whose every glossy wave shone out Mary&#8217;s self.
Mary&mdash;yet not Mary; Mary&#8217;s child&mdash;yet not <em>his</em>
child!&mdash;And Lucy, too;&mdash;O, the sorrow written in every furrow
of that kindly face, and&mdash;O God&mdash;by whom?</p>

<p class="new_para">The stars glimmered through the trees, the night-winds gently rocked the
little merry birds to sleep&mdash;midnight came on with its solemn
spirit-whispers&mdash;followed the gray dawn with its misty tears, and
still&mdash;there lay the peddler, stricken, smitten, on Nature&#8217;s kindly
breast; for there, too (but all unconscious of his misery&mdash;deaf to
his penitence), lay pillowed the dear head which had erst drooped so
lovingly upon his breast.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Very well done; button-holes strong and even, lining smooth; stitching,
like rows of seed pearl. This is no apprentice work,&rdquo; said Mr. John
Pray, as he held Lucy&#8217;s vests up to the light for a more minute
inspection. &ldquo;That&#8217;s a vest, now, as is a vest; won&#8217;t disgrace John
Pray&#8217;s shop; it would gladden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> even the eyes of my old boss,
Jacob Ford; and mighty particular he was, too, and mighty small wages
the old man paid, as I have occasion to know. Well, I made a vow then,
and thank God I have had grace to keep it, that if ever John Pray became
a master workman, he would do as he would be done by. So, I don&#8217;t ask
what wages other tailors give; that don&#8217;t matter to me. I don&#8217;t want to
die with any body&#8217;s groans in my ears. So, when a piece of work is
finished and handed in, I say, &lsquo;Now, John Pray, what should <em>you</em> think
was a fair price for <em>you</em> to receive, if <em>you</em> had done that &#8217;ere job?&rsquo;
That&#8217;s it; no dodging behind that question. &#8217;Specially when a man has
been through the opera<em>tive</em> mill himself. So, there&#8217;s your pay, Zekiel,
weighed out in that ere pair of Bible scales; and you may tell the old
lady, as you call her, that if she had served a regular apprenticeship
at the trade, she couldn&#8217;t have done better. What did you say her name
was? However, that&#8217;s no consequence&mdash;as long as she does the work
well. Here&#8217;s some more vests for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, I really don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; said Zekiel, &ldquo;I never heern tell her name.
She&#8217;s a bran new neighbor, and as I was coming into town every day with
my cart, she axed me, civil like, if I&#8217;d bring these vests to you. So, I
brung &#8217;em. I don&#8217;t mind doing a good turn for a fellow creetur, now and
then, specially when it &#8217;taint no bother,&rdquo; added Zekiel, with a grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;What did you spoil it for by saying that?&rdquo; said John Pray. &ldquo;I was just
going to clap you on the back for a clever fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You might go further, and clap a worse fellow on the back,&rdquo; answered
Zekiel. &ldquo;But I never boasts, I don&#8217;t. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use. If the ministers
tell the truth, we&#8217;ve all got to be weighed in the big scales up above,
where there ain&#8217;t no false weights&mdash;bad deeds agin good deeds.
Farmer Reed, I&#8217;m thinking, will be astonished when the balance on his
account is struck. But, good day; my parsnips and cabbages ought to be
in the market, instead of wilting at your door&mdash;even though you
city folks don&#8217;t know the taste of a fresh vegetable. Good day.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Rain&mdash;rain&mdash;rain; patter, patter. No sunshine to help Lucy&#8217;s
purblind eyes in stitching the dark vests; no sunshine to kiss open the
buttercups for Fanny. The birds took short and hasty flights from tree
to tree; the farmers slouched their hats over their faces, and whipped
up their teams; the little school children hurried back and forth with
their satchels, without stopping to look for chipmunks or for
ground-birds&#8217; nests; the bells on the baker&#8217;s cart lost their usual
merry tinkle, and the old fishman&#8217;s horn, as he went his Friday round,
gave forth a discordant, spiritless whine.</p>

<p class="new_para">Little Fanny had righted her grandmother&#8217;s work-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>basket, read
&ldquo;Jack and his Bean-Stalk,&rdquo; made houses on the slate, put the black
kitten to sleep in the old barrel, blown soap bubbles, till she was
tired, in the tin bowl, and had finally crept up on the little cot bed
and fallen asleep.</p>

<p class="new_para">Lucy sat back in her chair, and began counting over the money Zekiel had
brought her. It would relieve their present necessities. Fanny should
have some new clothes out of it, when farmer Smith&#8217;s rent was paid. But
the future? Lucy&#8217;s eyes were growing dimmer every day, and her limbs
more feeble. She might drop off suddenly, and then who would befriend
poor little Fanny? What lessons of sorrow had that loving little heart
to learn? By what thorny path would she thread life&#8217;s toilsome journey?</p>

<p class="new_para">Dear little Fanny! She could no more live without love than flowers
without sunshine. That <em>she</em> should ever weep tears, that no kindly hand
should wipe away; that she should hunger or thirst&mdash;shiver with
winter&#8217;s cold&mdash;faint under summer heat; that a harsh voice should
ever drive the blood from her lip or cheek&mdash;that her round limbs
should bend with premature toil&mdash;that sin should tempt her
helplessness&mdash;that sorrow should invite despair&mdash;that wrong
should ever seem right to Mary&#8217;s child! Poor Lucy bowed her head and
wept.</p>

<p class="new_para">The peddler looked in through the little casement window. He saw the
falling tears, he saw Lucy&#8217;s sorrowful gaze at the rosy little dreamer.
He needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> no explanation of the tableau. He knocked at the
door; Lucy&#8217;s tones were tremulous, as she bade him come in.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I thought you might be wanting some more silk,&rdquo; said he, respectfully,
with his eyes fixed upon little Fanny.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Sit down&mdash;sit down,&rdquo; said Lucy; for the tones of his voice were
kindly, <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Originally &ldquo;and and her&rdquo;">and her</span> heart in its loneliness craved sympathy. &ldquo;It is dull
weather we have, sir; one don&#8217;t mind it when all is right <em>here</em>,&rdquo; and
she laid her hand on her heart.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the peddler, in a low voice, still gazing at Fanny.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;The child sleeps,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;It was of her I was thinking when you
came in; it would be very bitter to die and leave her alone, sir;&rdquo; and
Lucy&#8217;s tears flowed again.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Have you no relatives&mdash;no friends, to whom you could intrust her?&rdquo;
asked the peddler, with his eyes bent on the ground.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;None, God help us,&rdquo; replied Lucy.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; and Lucy drew her chair nearer to the peddler, &ldquo;a great sorrow
may sometimes be in the heart, when smiles are on the face.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The peddler nodded, without trusting himself to speak.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;This poor heart has borne up until now, with what strength it might;
but now&rdquo;&mdash;and she glanced at little Fanny&mdash;&ldquo;O, sir&mdash;if I
could but take her with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;God will care for her,&rdquo; said the peddler, stooping to remove his hat,
that Lucy might not see his emotion.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Sometimes I feel that,&rdquo; replied Lucy; &ldquo;and then again&mdash;O, sir,
trouble makes the heart so fearful. My poor daughter&mdash;she was our
idol, sir&mdash;the sunbeam in our home; so good&mdash;so
beautiful&mdash;so light-hearted, till the trouble came. It was like a
lightning bolt, sir&mdash;it scathed and withered in one moment what was
before so fresh and fair; it blighted all our hopes, it blackened our
hearth-stone, it killed my husband&mdash;poor Jacob. Pardon me, sir, I
talk as if you had known our history. It was Mary&#8217;s lover, sir; he was
taken up for swindling, at our very door;&mdash;and yet I loved the
lad&mdash;for the ground she walked on he loved&mdash;for Mary&#8217;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>She</em> forgave him?&rdquo; asked the peddler, in a voice scarcely audible.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;She?&mdash;poor dear&mdash;she? All the world could not have made her
believe ill of him. She? Why, sir, she would sit at the window for
hours, watching the way he used to come. It crazed her, poor thing; and
then she would come and go just as she was bid. Her father saw her fade,
day by day, and cursed <em>him</em>;&mdash;he forgot business&mdash;every thing
went wrong&mdash;one way and another our money went, and then Jacob
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;He forgave <em>him</em>&mdash;your daughter&#8217;s lover, before he died?&rdquo; asked
the peddler, tremulously.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You have a kind heart, sir,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> Jacob&#8217;s heart
softened at the last;&mdash;he said we all needed God&#8217;s mercy. His last
words were &lsquo;Peace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;God be thanked,&rdquo; murmured the peddler; then adding, quickly, &ldquo;it must
have made <em>you</em> so much happier; you say you loved the lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;<em>even now</em>. We all err, sir. He was only
nineteen&mdash;young to marry; but Mary&#8217;s heart was bound up in him. He
didn&#8217;t mean it, sir&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how it was. God help us all.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, we buried Jacob; then we had none to look to&mdash;Mary and I. We
were poor. I was feeble. Then Mary&#8217;s lover came&mdash;the rich Mr. Shaw.
You are ill, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied the peddler; &ldquo;go on&mdash;your story interests
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Well, he wanted to marry Mary, although he saw how it was. It was all
one to her, you know, sir. She was crazed like&mdash;though so sweet and
gentle. I did it for the best, sir,&rdquo; said Lucy, mournfully. &ldquo;I thought
when I died Mary would have a home.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the peddler. &ldquo;He treated her kindly?&rdquo; he asked, with a
dark frown.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;For a little,&rdquo; answered Lucy. &ldquo;He wearied after a while. I might have
known it&mdash;I was to blame, sir&mdash;her heart was broken. When the
babe opened its eyes, she closed her&#8217;s, and I <em>alone</em> mourned for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;O, God!&rdquo; groaned the peddler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It moves you, sir,&rdquo; said Lucy; &ldquo;perhaps you, too, have known trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The peddler bowed his head without replying.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Then, sir, he brought a gay young thing into the house&mdash;his
mistress&mdash;not his wife. He never looked upon his child; he cursed
me and it. I gave it our name; I called it Fanny Ford; and we crept
away, the babe and I, up in the attic;&mdash;then all was
confusion&mdash;extravagance&mdash;ruin;&mdash;then he died,
sir&mdash;and since&mdash;you see us here&mdash;you know now, sir, why
I, leaning over the grave&#8217;s brink, yet shrink back and cling to life for

<em>her</em> sake,&rdquo; and she looked at Fanny.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Would you trust her with me?&rdquo; asked the peddler, with his eyes bent
upon the ground. &ldquo;I am all alone in the world&mdash;I have none to
love&mdash;none who love me&mdash;I am poor, but while I have a crust,
she shall never want.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is a great charge,&rdquo; replied Lucy. &ldquo;If you should weary, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Then may God forget me,&rdquo; said the peddler, earnestly, kneeling at
Lucy&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p class="new_para">Lucy bent on him a gaze searching as truth, but she read nothing in that
upturned face to give the lie to those solemn words. Pointing to Fanny,
she said,</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Before God&mdash;and as you hope for peace at the last?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The peddler bowed his head upon Lucy&#8217;s withered hand, and faltered out,
&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Good morning, Zekiel,&rdquo; said John Pray. &ldquo;Glad to see you&mdash;you must
tell the old lady to go ahead and finish this pile of vests in a
twinkling; business is brisk now. Why, what&#8217;s this?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;These
vests unfinished? How&#8217;s that? Don&#8217;t the pay suit? What&#8217;s the trouble
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Don&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Zekiel&mdash;&ldquo;don&#8217;t&mdash;stop a bit&mdash;I&#8217;m as tough as
any man&mdash;but there&#8217;s some things I can&#8217;t stand;&rdquo; and he dashed a
tear away.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked John. &ldquo;Is the old lady dissatisfied with
her pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Don&#8217;t&mdash;I say,&rdquo; said Zekiel;&mdash;&ldquo;hold up&mdash;don&#8217;t harrow a
man that way&mdash;she&#8217;s dead&mdash;I tell you stone dead. She never&#8217;ll
make no more vests for nobody. I never shall forget what I saw there
this morning, never.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You see she was old and infirm, and wan&#8217;t fit to work for any body any
how; but she had a little gran&#8217;child, fresh as a rose-bud, and she did
it for her, you see. Well, this morning I harnessed the old gray
horse&mdash;the black one is lame since Sunday&mdash;and reined up at
her door, as usual, to get the bundle. I knocked, and nobody came; then
I knocked again, then little rose-bud came tip-toeing to the door, with
her finger on her pretty lip, so&mdash;and whispered, &lsquo;grandma is
asleep; she has not woke up this great while.&rsquo; So I said&mdash;&lsquo;You&#8217;d
better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> speak to her and say, here&#8217;s Zekiel, come for the
bundle, cause you know she is partiklar like about sending it.&rsquo; So the
little rose-bud went up to the bed-side, and said&mdash;&lsquo;Grandma, here
is Zekiel, come for the vests.&rsquo; The old lady didn&#8217;t say nothing, and
rose-bud asked me to speak to her. I went up, and&mdash;John
Pray&mdash;the old lady was stone dead, and how was I going to tell that
to little rose-bud?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me that the child was all alone with the
corpse&mdash;nobody to see to the poor thing?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But I do, though,&rdquo; said Zekiel; &ldquo;it was enough to break a body&#8217;s heart,
and she so innocent like. I never was so put to it in my life, to know
what to do. There she had gone and tidied up the kitchen, hung the
tea-kettle on the fire as well as she knew how, and sat waiting for her
gran&#8217;mother to &lsquo;wake up,&rsquo; as she called it. How could I tell her she was

<em>dead</em>? Blast me if I could, to this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But you didn&#8217;t come away and leave her so?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Zekiel, &ldquo;for a peddler came in, and little rose-bud ran
up, glad-like, to see him; then I beckoned him one side, and told him
just how it was, and he turned as white as a turnip, and great big tears
rolled down his face, as he took little rose-bud up in his arms and
kissed her. Then he told me he was a kind of a relation like, and poor,
but that he would take the child and do the best he could by her; and I
knew he must be clever, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> children are powerful &#8217;cute, and
never take to cranky folks, any how&mdash;and so I left them, and came
blubbering into town. I vow it was enough to make the very stones cry,
to see little rose-bud take on so, after the old lady.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">There was no litigious will to be read, no costly effects to quarrel
about, in Lucy Ford&#8217;s poor cottage, and yet Golconda&#8217;s mines were all
too poor to buy the priceless treasures to which the peddler fell
heir&mdash;Mary&#8217;s picture and Mary&#8217;s child!</p>

<p class="new_para">With such talismans, what should he fear? what could he not accomplish?
He no longer walked with his head bowed upon his breast. The pure love
of that sinless little one restored his long-lost self-respect. Life was
dear to him. His eye regained its luster; his step its firmness. Even
his humble calling, now more than ever necessary, became to him
dignified and attractive. Fanny should have an education worthy of
Mary&#8217;s child. For the present, till he had amassed a little capital, he
must find her a home in some quiet farmer&#8217;s family, where he could
oversee her, in his occasional visits.</p>

<p class="new_para">Dear little Fanny! with her smiles and tears, she had already twined
herself round every fiber of his heart. &ldquo;Cousin John,&rdquo; as the peddler
taught her to call him, &ldquo;was to take care of her always, and she was to
love him dearly&mdash;dearly&mdash;better than any body, but mamma and
grandma.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Ah! there is Mrs. Quip&#8217;s head, poked out of the north chamber window. A
sure sign that it is five o&#8217;clock to the minute. Now she scuds across
the yard, making a prodigious flutter with her flying calico long-short,
among the hens and chickens, who take refuge in an upturned old barrel.
Snatching some sticks from the wood-pile, she scuds back again to the
kitchen, twitches a match from the mantel, lights the fire, hangs on the

<span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Comma added">tea-kettle,</span> jerks out the table, rattles on the cups and saucers,
plates, knives, forks, <abbr title="etcetera" class="silent">etc.</abbr>, and throws open every blind, door, and
window. This done, she flies up stairs, pokes Susan in the ribs, drags
Mary out on the floor, throws a mug of water in &ldquo;that lazy John&#8217;s face,&rdquo;
and intimates that &ldquo;breakfast will be on the table in less than fifteen
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">John rubs the water out of his eyes, muttering a few unmentionable
words. Susan and Mary make a transient visit to the looking-glass, and
descend the stair&#8217;s just as the coffee smokes upon the table. Mrs. Quip
frightens the chickens into the barrel again with her calico long-short
and the great bell that she ring at the barn-door to &ldquo;call the men folks
to breakfast,&rdquo; and takes her accustomed seat at the table.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Brown bread or white? baked beans or salt meat? doughnuts, cheese, or
apple-pie? which&#8217;ll you have?&rdquo; said Mrs. Quip to little Fanny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Ma&#8217;am?&rdquo; said Fanny, with a bewildered look.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Oh, dear; Susan Quip, for gracious&#8217; sake find out what that peddler&#8217;s
child wants; hurry, all of you. Baking to be done to-day; yesterday&#8217;s
ironing to finish; them new handkerchers to hem; John&#8217;s trowsers to
mend; buttery shelves to scour; brown bread sponge to set; yeast to
make; pickles to scald; head-cheese to fix: hurry, all of you. Susan
Quip, there&#8217;s the cat in the buttery, smack,
and&mdash;scissors&mdash;right into that buttermilk, arter a mouse.
Scat&mdash;scat; Susan Quip, that&#8217;s your doings&mdash;leaving the
buttery door open. John Quip, do you drownd that cat to-day. Don&#8217;t talk
to me of kittens; kittens is as plenty as peddlers&#8217; children. Hand me
that coffee, Susan Quip. Lord-a-mercy, there&#8217;s the fishman: run,
John&mdash;two mackerel, not more than sixpence a-piece; pinch &#8217;em in
the stomach, to see if they are fresh. If they are flabby, don&#8217;t take
&#8217;em; if they ain&#8217;t, do. Yes, every thing to do, to-day, and a little
more beside. Soft soap to&mdash;&mdash;Heavens and earth, John Quip,
that mackerel man hasn&#8217;t given you the right change by two cents. Here,
stop him! John Quip&mdash;Susan&mdash;get out of the way, all of you;
I&#8217;ll go myself,&rdquo; and the calico long-short started in full pursuit of
the mackerel defaulter.</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor little Fanny! no Green Mountain boy, set down in the rush of the
city, ever felt half so crazy. Mrs. Quip, with her snap-dragon,
touch-me-not-manners, high-pitched voice, and heavy tramp, was<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> such a contrast to her dear
grandmother, with her soft tones, noiseless step, and gentle ways. Fanny
was afraid to move for fear she should cross Mrs. Quip&#8217;s track. She did
not know whether she were hungry or thirsty. She marveled at the
railroad velocity with which the food disappeared, and pitied Mrs. Quip

<em>so</em> much for having such a quantity of things to do all in a minute!</p>

<p class="new_para">The next day after Fanny&#8217;s arrival at Butternut farm, was Sunday. Mrs.
Quip was up betimes, as usual, but her activity took a devotional turn.
She was out to the barn fifty times a minute, to see &ldquo;if the horse and
waggin was getting harnessed for meetin&#8217;,&rdquo;&mdash;not but <em>Mr.</em> Quip was
still above ground, but as far as he had any voice in family matters, he
might as well have been under. Mrs. Quip was up in Susan&#8217;s room (or, as
she pronounced it, <em>Sew</em>san), to see if she was learning her catechise;
she was padlock-ing John Quip&#8217;s Sunday temptation, in the shape of the
&ldquo;Thrilling Adventures of Jack Bowsprit;&rdquo; she was giving the sitting-room
as Sabbatical and funereal an aspect as possible, by setting the chairs
straight up against the walls, shutting all the blinds, and putting into
the cupboard every thing that squinted secular-wise.</p>

<p class="new_para">Fanny, oppressed by the gloom within doors, crept out into the warm
sunshine, and seating herself under a tree in the yard, was looking at a
few clover blossoms which she had plucked beside her. She was thinking
of the pleasant Sundays she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> passed with her dear
grandmother, and how she used to sit on the door-step of the cottage,
and tell her how God taught the little birds to build their cradle
nests, and find their way through the air; and how He provided even for
the little ants, who so patiently, grain by grain, built their houses in
the gravel walk; and how He kept the grass green with the dew and
showers, and ripened the fruit, and opened the blossoms with the warm
sunshine, and how He was always watching over us, caring for our wants,
listening to our cries, pitying us for our sorrows, and making His sun
to shine even on those who forget to thank Him for it. But
see&mdash;Fanny has dropped her clover blossoms, for Mrs. Quip has
seized her by the arm, and says,</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You wicked child, you! To think of picking a flower <em>Sunday</em>! What do
you expect will become of you when you die? What do you think the
neighbors will think? Sinful child! There&rdquo;&mdash;slamming her down on a
cricket in the sitting-room&mdash;&ldquo;sit down, and see if you can learn
what the chief end of man is, afore meeting time. Flowers of a <em>Sunday</em>!
or flowers any day, for the matter of that, I never could see the sense
of &#8217;em. Even the Bible says, &lsquo;they toil not, neither do they spin.&rsquo;
Gracious goodness&mdash;Sewsan Quip, Mrs. Snow&#8217;s kerriage has just
started for meetin&#8217;. Get your things, all of you. Sewsan, see to that
peddler&#8217;s child; mind that she don&#8217;t take no flowers to the Lord&#8217;s
temple; John Quip, you shan&#8217;t wear them gloves; they cost<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> twenty-five cents at the
finding-store; and if you think that I bought &#8217;em for you to drive in,
you are mistaken; now put &#8217;em in your pocket till you get into the
meetin&#8217;-us porch; that will save &#8217;em a sight; them leather reins will
wear &#8217;em all threadbare in less than no time. Mercy on us, the string is
off my bunnet. Sewsan, that&#8217;s your doing. Run and bring me a pin off the
third shelf in the buttery, under the yellow quart bowl. I picked it up
and put it there this morning. Make haste, now. John Quip, stop cracking
your whip that way on the holy Sabbath day. What do you suppose your
dead grandpa would think, if he should hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The wagon was brought, and its living freight stowed carefully away in
the remote corners. The oil-cloth covering was buttoned carefully down
on all sides, as it had been during the winter; Mrs. Quip said it was
hot, but maybe it would crack the oil-cloth to roll it up for the breeze
to play through. Susan, Mary, and Fanny, therefore, took a vapor bath,
on the back seat. Mrs. Quip, seated at John&#8217;s side, excluded, with her
big black bonnet, any stray breeze which might have found entrance that
way, to the refreshing of the gasping passengers. Dobbin moved on; he
had been up that hot, dusty hill, many a Sunday before, and understood
perfectly well how to keep his strength in reserve for the usual
accession to his load on the village green, in the shape of the
Falstaffian Aunt Hepsibah, Miss Butts, the milliner, and Deacon Tufts,
who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> duly piled in on the gasping occupants behind. Mrs.
Quip being also on the alert to fill up any stray chinks in the &ldquo;waggin&rdquo;
with &ldquo;them children who stopped to rest in the road, when they oughter
go straight to meetin&#8217;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">The unlading of Mrs. Quip&#8217;s wagon at the meeting-house door, was an
exhibition much &ldquo;reckoned on&rdquo; by the graceless young men of the village,
who always collected on the steps for the purpose, and with mock
gallantry assisted Mrs. Quip in clambering over the wheels, suppressing
their mirth at her stereotyped exhortation, as she glanced at Dobbin,
&ldquo;to see that they didn&#8217;t start the critter.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">It was a work of time to draw out the unctuous Aunt Hepsibah; Deacon
Tufts, more wiry and agile, &ldquo;helped hisself,&rdquo; as Mrs. Quip remarked. The
crowning delight was the evacuation of the wagon, by Miss
Butts&mdash;who, with a mincing glance at the men, circumspectly
extended one finger of her right hand&mdash;gingerly exposed the tip of
the toe of her slipper, and with sundry little shrieks and exclamations,
prolonged indefinitely the delicious agony of her descent, as the young
gentlemen by turns profanely touched her virgin elbows. Thirty-nine
years of single blessedness had fully prepared her to appreciate these
little masculine attentions, of which she always made an exact
memorandum in her note-book (affixing the date) on reaching her seat in
church. The unappropriated Miss Butts wore rose-buds in her bonnet, as
emblematical of love&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> young spring-time, and dressed in
shepherdess style; nature, perhaps, suggesting the idea, by placing the

<em>crook</em> in her back.</p>

<p class="new_para">Poor little Fanny was as much out of her element at Butternut farm as a
humming-bird in a cotton-mill. She could not &ldquo;heel a stocking,&rdquo; although
Mrs. Quip &ldquo;knew how as soon as she was born.&rdquo; She could neither
chain-stitch, cross-stitch, button-hole-stitch, nor cat-stitch, though
she often got a stitch in her side trying to &ldquo;get out of Mrs. Quip&#8217;s
way.&rdquo; She did not know &ldquo;whether her grandmother was orthodox or
Unitarian;&rdquo; whether Cousin John &ldquo;belonged to the church,&rdquo; or not; in
fact, as Mrs. Quip remarked, the child seemed to her &ldquo;not to have the
slightest idea what she was created for.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Cousin John&rdquo; came at last! with an empty pack, a full purse, and a
fuller heart. Fanny flew into his outspread arms, and nestled into his
bosom, with a fullness of joy which the <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Originally &ldquo;friendles sonly&rdquo;">friendless only</span> can feel. Out of
sound of Mrs. Quip&#8217;s trip-hammer tongue, out of sight of Mrs. Quip&#8217;s
omniscient eyes, Fanny whispered in &ldquo;Cousin John&#8217;s&rdquo; ear, crying,
laughing, and kissing the while, all her little troubles. Cousin John
did not smile, for he knew too well how keenly the little trusting
heart, which beat against his own, could suffer or enjoy; so he wiped
her tears away, and told her that she should say good-by to Butternut
farm, and accompany him on his next trip, as far as Canton, where he
would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> leave her with a nice old lady, who had a red and green
parrot, and who taught a school for the village children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">It was a pretty sight&mdash;Cousin John and Fanny; she, skipping on
before him to pluck a flower, then returning to glide her little hand in
his, and walk contentedly by his side; or, standing on some stile,
waiting to be lifted over, with her bonnet blown back, and her bright
little face beaming with smiles; Cousin John sometimes answering her
questions at random, as the tones of her voice, or the expression of her
face, recalled her lost mother; sometimes looking proudly upon the bud,
as he thought how sweet and fair would be the blossom, but more often
gazing at her tearfully, as Lucy&#8217;s last solemn words rang in his ears.</p>

<p class="new_para">Percy was a riddle to himself. In the child&#8217;s pure presence, every spot
upon his soul&#8217;s mirror he would have wiped away. Lips which had never
framed a prayer for themselves, now murmured one for <em>her</em>. Feet which
had strayed into forbidden paths, would fain have found for <em>her</em> tiny
feet the straight and narrow path of life.</p>

<p class="new_para">Insensibly &ldquo;a little child was leading him&rdquo;&mdash;nearer to Thee, O God,
nearer to Thee.</p>

<p class="new_para">Little Fanny&#8217;s joy on this pedestrian tour was irrepressible; but the
journey was not all performed on foot: many a good-natured farmer gave
them a lift of a mile or two, and many a kind-hearted farm<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>er&#8217;s wife offered Fanny a cake, or
a drink of milk, for the sake of her own sun-burnt children, yet blessed
in a mother&#8217;s love. Then there were friendly trees to shade them from
the scorching noon-day sun, where the peddler could unstrap his pack,
and Fanny throw off her bonnet and go to sleep in his lap. Sparkling
brooks there were, to lave their faces, or quench their thirst, and
flowers whose beauty might have tempted on tardier feet than Fanny&#8217;s.
Their only trouble was &ldquo;Cousin John&#8217;s pack;&rdquo; and Fanny&#8217;s slender stock
of arithmetic was exhausted in trying to compute how many pieces of
tape, how many papers of needles, how many skeins of thread, must be
sold before he could buy a horse and wagon to help him to carry his
load. The peddler, too, had his air-castles to build, to which the
afore-mentioned tape, needles, and thread were but the stepping-stones.
Fanny once placed where she could be contented, and kindly treated, and
Cousin John must leave her, to woo Dame Fortune, for her sake, more
speedily.</p>

<p class="new_para">Fanny shed a few tears when she heard this, poor child! and wondered if
there were many Mrs. Quips in the world; but the motherly face of Mrs.
Chubbs, with her three chins, the queer gabble of the red and green
parrot, and more than all, the society of playfellows of her own age,
were no small mitigations of the parting with Cousin John.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Chubbs would most decidedly have been turned out of office by any
<strong>modern</strong> school commit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>tee. When a little creature who should have
been in the nursery, was sent to her charge, &ldquo;to be out of the way,&rdquo;
Mrs. Chubbs oftener allowed it to stretch its little limbs on the
grass-plat, front of the door, than she set it poring over a
spelling-book. She never thumped geography or arithmetic into her pupils
with a ferule. A humming-top string, or a kite-tail fragment protruding
from a childish pocket, excited in her no indignation. A bit of
gingerbread, or an apple, munched by a little urchin who had made an
early or an indifferent breakfast, did not appear to her old-fashioned
vision an offense worthy of the knout or the guillotine. In fact, Mrs.
Chubb&#8217;s heart was as capacious as her pockets, and <em>their</em> unfathomable
depths were a constant marvel to her pupils.</p>

<p class="new_para">As to the parrot, he constituted himself &ldquo;a committee&rdquo; of one, and
called out occasionally, &ldquo;Mind your lessons, I say,&rdquo; to Fanny&#8217;s great
diversion. And Fanny did &ldquo;mind&rdquo; them; for she loved good Mrs. Chubb, and
then she had a little private plan of her own for astounding Cousin
John, one of these days, with her profound erudition.</p>

<p class="new_para">And so time passed&mdash;the little homesick lump in her throat had
quite disappeared; she sang&mdash;she skipped&mdash;she laughed&mdash;a
merrier little grig never danced out a slipper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">Will my indulgent reader skip over ten years with me?&mdash;he might

substantial-looking building, in which young ladies are &ldquo;finished.&rdquo;
Passing by the long dining-hall, with its bare tavern-y looking table,
and rows of bamboo chairs, let us ascend yonder marble stairs (for the
school-house, let me tell you, was once an aristocratic old mansion),
and turn down that long passage to the right. Now let us stop before No.

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Fanny, what pains you are taking with your hair to-day!&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;Is
this Cousin John who has written you such interminable letters from
&lsquo;El-Dorado,&rsquo; to turn out, after all, your lover? I hope not, for I fancy
him some venerable Mentor, with a solemn face, and oracular voice,
jealous as Bluebeard of any young man who looks at you. How old is this
paragon?&mdash;handsome or ugly? I am dying to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Thirty-six,&rdquo; replied Fanny; &ldquo;and as I remember him, with dark, curling
hair, a broad, expansive brow, eyes one would never weary looking into,
a voice singularly rich and sweet, and a form perfect but for a trifling
stoop in the shoulders. That is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> Cousin John,&rdquo; said Fanny,
drawing the comb through her ringlets.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Stoop in the shoulders! I thought as much,&rdquo; mockingly laughed the merry
Kate. &ldquo;If he had &lsquo;a stoop in the shoulders&rsquo; ten years ago, how do you

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It matters very little to me,&rdquo; replied Fanny, with a little annoyance

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;How am I to construe that?&rdquo; asked Kate, crossing her two forefingers
(&ldquo;it matters very little to you&rdquo;). &ldquo;Does it mean that love is out of the
question between you two, or that you would have him if Lucifer stood in
your path?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Construe it as it best suits you,&rdquo; replied Fanny, with the most
provoking nonchalance.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But &lsquo;a stoop in the shoulders,&rsquo;&rdquo; persisted the tormenting Kate. &ldquo;I
don&#8217;t care to have a man&#8217;s face handsome, provided it is intelligent,
but I do insist upon a fine form, correct morals, and a good
disposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Fanny laughed&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose you think to wind <em>your</em> husband round
your little finger, like a skein of silk.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Of course <em>you</em> will be quite perfect;&mdash;never, for instance,
appear before your husband in curl papers, or slip-shod?&rdquo; asked Fanny;
&ldquo;never make him eat bad pies or puddings?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; answered Kate, &ldquo;if he is tractable&mdash;not; if

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;You will wink at his cigars?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;He might do worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;If he will my snuff-box,&rdquo; said Kate, laughing. &ldquo;Heigho&mdash;I feel

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Kate, why do you always choose to wear a mask?&rdquo; asked Fanny; &ldquo;why do
you take so much pains to make a censorious world believe you the very

all this, Fanny, with that incomparable Cousin John in your thoughts;

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="new_para">Was this &ldquo;little Fanny?&rdquo; this tall, graceful creature of seventeen, the
little thing who bade him good-by at Mrs. Chubb&#8217;s door, ten years since,
with her pinafore stuffed in the corner of her eye? &ldquo;Little Fanny,&rdquo; with
that queenly presence? Cousin John almost felt as if he ought to ask
leave to touch her hand; ah&mdash;she is the same little Fanny after
all&mdash;frank, guileless, and free-hearted. She flies into his arms,
puts up her rosy lips for a kiss, and says &ldquo;<em>Dear</em> Cousin John.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; was all he could find voice to say, for in truth, she
was Mary&#8217;s own self.</p>

<p class="new_para">Yes&mdash;Fanny was very lovely, with those rippling waves of silken
hair, and the light and shadow, flitting like summer clouds over her
speaking face. Cousin John held her off at arm&#8217;s length. Yes, she was
very lovely. &ldquo;How much she had changed!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;And you, too,&rdquo; said Fanny, seating herself beside him. &ldquo;You look so
much better; the stoop in your shoulders is quite gone; you are bronzed
a little, but all the better for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Cousin John, &ldquo;more especially as I could not help it,
not even to please &lsquo;little Fanny.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Ah&mdash;but I am no longer <em>little</em> Fanny,&rdquo; she said, blushing
slightly. &ldquo;I have crammed a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> books into my head since
I saw you, and done considerable thinking beside.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;And what has your thinking all amounted to?&rdquo; asked Cousin John, half
playfully, half seriously.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Just to this&mdash;that you are the very best cousin in the world, and
that I never can repay you for all you have been to the poor, little
friendless orphan,&rdquo; said Fanny, with brimming eyes.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; said Cousin John. &ldquo;I am more than repaid in these last
ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Hours flew like seconds, while Percy narrated his adventures by sea and
land, and listened to Fanny&#8217;s account of herself; the old duenna,
meanwhile, walking uneasily up and down the hall, occasionally making an
errand into the sitting-room, and muttering to herself as she went out,
that she had heard before of boarding-school &ldquo;cousins,&rdquo; and that he was
altogether too handsome a man to be allowed such a long <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></em>
with Miss Fanny; and so she reported at head-quarters, but the Principal
being just then unfortunately engaged in examining a new French teacher,
who had applied for employment, could not give the affair the attention
Miss Miffit insisted upon.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mr. Thurston Grey, too, was on the anxious seat; for the mischievous
Kate had informed him &ldquo;that Fanny was holding a protracted meeting in
the best parlor, with the handsomest man she ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Nothing like a rival to precipitate matters! The declaration which had
so long been trembling on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> Mr. Grey&#8217;s lips, found its way into a
billet-doux, and was forwarded to Fanny that very night, and presented
by Kate in the presence of Cousin John, &ldquo;to test,&rdquo; as she said, &ldquo;the
quality of his <em>cousin</em>-ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Cousin John was not jealous of &ldquo;little Fanny!&rdquo; how absurd! Little Fanny!
whom he had carried in his arms, who had slept on his breast. In fact he
laughed quite merrily at the idea, louder than was at all necessary to
convince himself of the nonsense of the thing, when he read Mr. Grey&#8217;s
proposal; (for Fanny had no secrets from &ldquo;Cousin John.&rdquo;) True he wound
up his watch twice that morning, and put on odd stockings, and found it
quite impossible to decide which of his cravats he should wear that day,
and looked in the glass very attentively for some time, and forgot to
smoke, but he wasn&#8217;t <em>jealous</em> of little Fanny. Of course he wasn&#8217;t!</p>

festooned with a mock chain; his shirt bosom fastened with green studs,
and his nether limbs encased in a pair of snake-skin pantaloons. As the
waiter closed the door to execute his order, he delivered himself of the
following soliloquy, between the whiffs of his cigar:</p>

Your fine broadcloth suit don&#8217;t look much like your red and blue prison
uniform, Mr. Percy Lee. Your crop of curly black hair is <em>rather</em> more

killed her own mother? and, pretty as she is, by the eternal, she<span class="pagenum"><a

merry eyes under their soft lashes, and her woman&#8217;s heart, true to

hearing Katy say her lesson, and telling the cook about dinner? And when

it? These guide books are mainly written by sentimental old maids; who,

<h2>A WORD TO SHOP-KEEPERS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">In one respect&mdash;nay, in more, if so please you&mdash;I am
unfeminine. I detest shopping. I feel any thing but affection for Eve
every time I am forced to do it. But we must be clean and whole, even in
this dirt-begrimed, lawless city; where ash-barrels and ash-boxes, with
spikes of protruding nails for the unwary, stand on every sidewalk,
waiting the bidding of balmy zephyrs to sift their dusky contents on our
luckless clothes. All the better for shop-keepers; indeed, I am not at
all sure, that they and the street-cleaning gentry do not, as doctors
and druggists are said to do, play into each other&#8217;s hands!</p>

<p class="new_para">Apart from my natural and never-to-be-uprooted dislike to the little
feminine recreation of shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>ping, is the pain I experience
whenever I am forced to take part in it, at the snubbing system
practiced by too many shop-keepers toward those whose necessities demand
a frugal outlay. Any frivolous female fool, be she showily dressed, may
turn a whole storefull of goods topsy-turvy at her capricious will,
although she may end in taking nothing away but her own idiotic
presence; while a poor, industrious woman, with the hardly-earned dollar
in her calico pocket, may not presume to deliberate, or to differ from
the clerk as to its most frugal investment. My blood often boils as I
stand side by side with such a one. I, by virtue of better apparel,
receiving respectful treatment; she&mdash;crimsoning with shame, like
some guilty thing, at the rude reply.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now, gentlemen, imagine yourselves in this woman&#8217;s place. <em>I</em> have no
need to do so, because I have stood there. Imagine her, with her
fatherless, hungry children by her side, plying the needle late into the
night, for the pitiful sum of seventy-five cents a week, as I once did.
Imagine her, with this discouraging price of her eye-sight and strength,
creeping forth with her little child by the hand, peeping cautiously
through the glass windows of stores, to decide unobtrusively upon
fabrics and labeled prices, or vainly trying to read human feeling
enough in their owners&#8217; faces to insure her from contemptuous insult at
the smallness and cheapness of her contemplated purchase. At length,
with many misgivings, she glides in amid rustling silks<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> and laces, that drape hearts
which God made womanly and tender like her own, but which Fashion and
Mammon have crushed to ashes in their vice-like clasp; hearts which
never knew a sorrow greater than a misfitting dress, or a badly-matched
ribbon, and whose owners&#8217; lips curl as the new-comer holds thoughtfully
between her thin fingers the despised fabric, carelessly tossed at her
by the impatient clerk.</p>

would tearfully ask the reason, were it not prematurely sorrow-trained.</p>

breaking heart, upon a little child, for the comfort and sympathy that
you found nowhere else in the wide world beside. <em>You</em> never wound your
arms about her in the silent night, drenching brow, cheek and lip with
your tears, as you prayed God, in your wild despair, dearly as you loved
her, to take her to himself; for, living, she, too, must drink of the
cup that might not pass away from your sorrow-steeped lips.</p>

<span class="sub_head">OR, A HAIR-BREADTH ESCAPE FOR SOME PARISH.</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">I once had a narrow escape from being a minster&#8217;s wife. No wonder you
laugh. Imagine a vestry-meeting called to decide upon the width of <em>my</em>
bonnet-strings, or the proper altitude of the bow on that bonnet&#8217;s side.
Imagine my being called to an account for asking Mrs. A. to tea, without
including the rest of the alphabet. Imagine my parishioners expecting me
to attend a meeting of the Dorcas Society in the morning, the Tract
Society in the afternoon, and the Foreign Mission Society in the
evening, five days in the week&mdash;and make parish calls on the
sixth&mdash;besides keeping the buttons on my husband&#8217;s shirts, and
taking care of my &ldquo;nine children, and one at the breast.&rdquo; Imagine a
self-constituted committee of female Paul Prys running their arms up to
the elbows in my pickle-jar&mdash;rummaging my
cupboards&mdash;cross-questioning my maid-of-all-work, and catechizing
my grocer as to the price I paid for tea. Imagine my ministerial progeny
prohibited chess and checkers by the united voice of the parish.
Christopher!</p>

<p class="new_para">Still, the world lost a great deal by my non-acceptance of that &ldquo;call.&rdquo;
What would I have done? I would not, on Saturday afternoon (that holiday
which should never, on any pretext, be wrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> from our
over-schooled, over-taught, children), have put the finishing touch to
the crook in their poor little spines, by drumming them all into a
Juvenile Sewing Society, to stitch pinafores for the Kankaroo heathen.
What would I have done? I would have ate, drunk, slept, and laughed,
like any other decent man&#8217;s wife. I would have educated my children as
do other men&#8217;s wives, to suit myself, which would have been to turn them
out to grass till they were seven years old, before which time no child,
in my opinion, should ever see the inside of a school-room; and after
that, given them study in hom&oelig;opathic, and exercise in allopathic
quantities. I would have taken the liberty, as do other men&#8217;s wives,
when family duties demanded it, to send word to morning callers that I
&ldquo;was engaged.&rdquo; I should have taken a walk on Sunday, if my health
required it, without asking leave of the deacons of my parish. I would
have gone into my husband&#8217;s study, every Saturday night, and crossed out
every line in his forthcoming sermon, <em>after &ldquo;sixthly.&rdquo;</em> I would have
encouraged a glorious beard on my husband&#8217;s sacerdotal chin, not under
the cowardly plea of a preventive to a possible bronchitis, but because
a minister&#8217;s wife has as much right to a good-looking husband as a
lay-woman. I would have invited all the children in my parish to drink
tea with me once a week, to play hunt the slipper, and make molasses
candy; and I would have made them each a rag-baby to look at, while
their well-meaning, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> infatuated Sunday-school teachers, were
bothering their brains with the doctrine of election. That&#8217;s what <em>I</em>

<span class="sub_head">OR, WHICH SHALL RULE.</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Give me two cents, I say, or I&#8217;ll kick you!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">I turned to look at the threatener. It was a little fellow about as tall
as my sun-shade, stamping defiance at a fine, matronly-looking woman,
who must have been his mother, so like were her large black eyes to the
gleaming orbs of the boy. &ldquo;Give me two cents, I say, or I&#8217;ll kick you,&rdquo;
he repeated, tugging fiercely at her silk dress to find the pocket,
while every feature in his handsome face was distorted with passion.
Surely she will not do it, said I to myself, anxiously awaiting the
issue, as I apparently examined some ribbons in a shop-window; surely
she will not be so mad, so foolish, so untrue to herself, so untrue to
her child, so belie the beautiful picture of healthy maternity, so
God-impressed in that finely-developed form and animated face. Oh, if I
might speak to her, and beg her not to do it, thought I, as she put her
hand in her pocket, and the fierce look died away on the boy&#8217;s face, and
was succeeded by one of triumph; if I might tell her that she is
fostering the noisome weeds that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> surely choke the
flowers&mdash;sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But the boy is so passionate; it is less trouble to grant his request
than to deny him.&rdquo; Granting this were so; who gave you a right to weigh
your own ease in the balance with your child&#8217;s soul? Who gave you a
right to educate him for a convict&#8217;s cell, or the gallows? But,
thoughtless, weakly indulgent, cruel-kind mother, it is not easier, as
you selfishly, short-sightedly reason, to grant his request than to deny
it; not easier for him&mdash;not easier for you. The appetite for rule
grows by what it feeds on. Is he less domineering now than he was
yesterday? Will he be less so to-morrow than he is to-day? Certainly not.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But I have not time to contest every inch of ground with him.&rdquo; Take
time then&mdash;make time; neglect every thing else, but neglect not
that. With every child comes this turning point: <em>Which shall be the
victor&mdash;my mother or I?</em> and it must be met. She is no true mother
who dodges or evades it. True&mdash;there will be a fierce struggle at
first; but be firm as a rock; recede not one inch; there may be two,
three, or even more, but the battle once won, as won it shall be if you
are a faithful mother, it is won for this world&mdash;ay, perhaps for
another.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;But I am not at liberty to control him thus; when parents do not pull
together in the harness, the reins of government will slacken; when I
would restrain and correct him, his father interferes; <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Originally &ldquo;childred&rdquo;">chil<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>dren</span> are quick-witted, and my boy
sees his advantage. What can I do, unsustained and single-handed?&rdquo;
True&mdash;true&mdash;God help the child then. Better for him had he
never been born; better for you both, for so surely as the beard grows
upon that little chin, so surely shall he bring your gray hairs with
sorrow to the grave; and so surely shall he curse you for your very
indulgence, before he is placed in the dishonored one your parental
hands are digging for him.</p>

<p class="new_para">These things need not be&mdash;ought not to be. Oh! if parents had but a
firm hand to govern, and yet a ready ear for childish sympathy; if they
would agree&mdash;whatever they might say in private&mdash;never to
differ in presence of their children, as to their government; if the
dissension-breeding &ldquo;Joseph&#8217;s coat&rdquo; were banished from every
hearthstone; if there were less weak indulgence and less asceticism; if
the bow were neither entirely relaxed, nor strained so tightly that it
broke; if there were less out-door dissipation, and more home-pleasures;
if parents would not forget that they were once children, nor, on the
other hand, forget that their children will be one day parents; if there
were less form of godliness, and more godliness (for children are
Argus-eyed; it is not what you preach, but what you practice), we should
then have no beardless skeptics, no dissolute sons, no runaway
marriages, no icy barriers between those rocked in the same
cradle&mdash;nursed at the same breast.</p>

<h2>TOM PAX&#8217;S CONJUGAL SOLILOQUY.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Pax is an authoress. I knew it when I married her. I liked the
idea. I had not tried it then. I had not a clear idea what it was to
have one&#8217;s wife belong to the public. I thought mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>riage was
marriage, brains not excepted. I was mistaken. Mrs. Pax is very kind: I
don&#8217;t wish to say that she is not. Very obliging: I would not have you
think the contrary; but when I put my arm round Mrs. Pax&#8217;s waist, and
say, &ldquo;Mary, I love you,&rdquo; she smiles in an absent, moonlight-kind of a
way, and says, &ldquo;Yes, to-day is Wednesday, is it not? I must write an
article for &lsquo;The Weekly Monopolizer&rsquo; to-day.&rdquo; That dampens my ardor; but
presently I say again, being naturally affectionate, &ldquo;Mary, I love you;&rdquo;
she replies (still abstractedly), &ldquo;Thank you, how do you think it will
do to call my next article for &lsquo;The Weekly Monopolizer,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Stray
Waif?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Pax sews on all my shirt-buttons with the greatest good humor: I
would not have you think she does not; but with her thoughts still on
&ldquo;The Weekly Monopolizer,&rdquo; she sews them on the flaps, instead of the
wristbands. This is inconvenient; still Mrs. Pax is kindness itself; I
make no complaint.</p>

<p class="new_para">I am very fond of walking. After dinner I say to Mrs. Pax, &ldquo;Mary, let us
take a walk.&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;Yes, certainly, I must go down town to read the
proof of my article for &lsquo;The Monopolizer.&rsquo;&rdquo; So, I go down town with Mrs.
Pax. After tea I say, &ldquo;Mary, let us go to the theater to-night;&rdquo; she
says, &ldquo;I would be very happy to go, but the atmosphere is so bad there,
the gas always escapes, and my head must be clear to-morrow, you know,
for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> have to write the last chapter of my forthcoming work,
&lsquo;Prairie Life.&rsquo;&rdquo; So I stay at home with Mrs. Pax, and as I sit down by
her on the sofa, and as nobody comes in, I think that this, after all,
is better, (though I must say my wife looks well at the Opera, and I
like to take her there). I put my arm around Mrs. Pax. It is a habit I
have. In comes the servant; and brings a handful of letters for her by
mail, directed to &ldquo;Julia Jesamine!&rdquo; (that&#8217;s my wife&#8217;s <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</span></em>). I
remove my arm from her waist, because she says &ldquo;they are probably
business letters which require immediate notice.&rdquo; She sits down at the
table, and breaks the seals. Four of them are from fellows who want &ldquo;her
autograph.&rdquo; <em>Mrs. Pax&#8217;s</em> autograph! The fifth is from a gentleman who,
delighted with her last book, which he says &ldquo;mirrored his own soul&rdquo; (how
do you suppose Mrs. Pax found out how to &ldquo;mirror <em>his</em> soul?&rdquo;) requests
&ldquo;permission to correspond with the charming authoress.&rdquo; &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; my
wife! &ldquo;his soul!&rdquo; Mrs. Pax! The sixth is from a gentleman who desires
&ldquo;the loan of five hundred dollars, as he has been unfortunate in
business, and has heard that her works have been very remunerative.&rdquo;
Five hundred dollars for John Smith, from my wife! The seventh letter is
from a man at the West, offering her her own price to deliver a lecture
before the Pigtown Young Men&#8217;s Institute. <em>I like that!</em></p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Pax opens her writing desk; it is one I gave her; takes some
delicate buff note-paper; I gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> her that, too; dips her gold
pen (my gift) into the inkstand, and writes&mdash;writes till eleven
o&#8217;clock. Eleven! and I, her husband, Tom Pax, sit there and wait for
her.</p>

<p class="new_para">The next morning when I awake, I say, &ldquo;Mary dear?&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;Hush!
don&#8217;t speak, I&#8217;ve just got a capital subject to write about for &lsquo;The
Weekly Monopolizer.&rsquo;&rdquo; Not that I am <em>complaining</em> of Mrs. Pax, not at
all; not that I don&#8217;t like my wife to be an authoress: I do. To be sure
I can&#8217;t say that I knew <em>exactly</em> what it involved. I did not know, for
instance, that the Press in speaking of her by her <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</span></em> would
call her &ldquo;<strong>Our</strong> Julia,&rdquo; but I would not have you think I object to her
being literary. On the contrary, I am not sure that I do not rather like
it; but I ask the Editor of &ldquo;The Weekly Monopolizer,&rdquo; as a man&mdash;as
a Christian&mdash;as a husband&mdash;if he thinks it right&mdash;if it
is doing as he would be done by&mdash;to monopolize my wife&#8217;s thoughts
as early as five o&#8217;clock in the morning? I merely ask for information. I
trust I have no resentful feelings toward the animal.</p>

<h2>TEA AND DARNING NEEDLES &ldquo;FOR TWO!&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="new_para">Not long since, John Bull, in the columns of an English newspaper,
growled out his intense disgust at the &ldquo;trash in the shape of American
lady books,&rdquo; which constantly afflicted him from the other side of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p class="new_para">Here is a book called &ldquo;Letters from the United States, Canada, and
Cuba,&rdquo; by the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr> Amelia M. Murray, a lady of supposable refinement,
education, and of the highest social position in England; a lady whose
daily bread was <em>not</em> dependent upon the immediate publication of her
book; who had leisure and opportunity carefully to write, and to correct
and revise what she had written.</p>

<p class="new_para">We propose giving a few extracts to show what advance has been made upon
American literature, by our aristocratic British sister. But before
beginning, we wish to throw our glove in John Bull&#8217;s face, and defy him
to produce a greater, or even an <em>equal</em> amount of stupid twaddle,
unrhetorical sentences, hap-hazard conclusions, petty, egotistical,
uninteresting details, narrow-minded views, and utter want of talent,
from between the covers of any <em>American</em> lady book yet published.</p>

<p class="new_para">The political question discussed by &ldquo;the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr>&rdquo; authoress, we shall not
meddle with further than to say, first, that her book contains not one
new idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> upon the subject; secondly, that her advocacy of a
system which condemns a portion of her own sex to helpless, hopeless,
brutal prostitution, reflects as little credit on her standard of what
is lovely and of good report in woman, as does her book upon female
English literature.</p>

<p class="new_para">We quote the following specimens of Miss Murray&#8217;s style:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;At the house of his sister I saw another work by the same artist: two
children, the one as an angel leading the awakened soul of the other,
with an inscription below; very pretty!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Again.</p>

<p class="new_para">Speaking of the cholera in Boston, and the practice of using hot vinegar
there, as a disinfective, she says:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I was told a carriage of this <em>fumigated</em> liquid had been driven
through the streets; there are deaths here every day and some at
Newport, but <em>it</em> is not believed to be contagious at present, only
carrying off the profligate and the debilitated.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Again.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Till my introduction to the Governor of New York I did not know that
each State has a Governor. Governor Seymour lives at Albany. Some of
those Governors are only elected for two years, <em>and</em> this gentleman
does credit to popular choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">So much for the <em>Queen&#8217;s</em> English! Now for one or two specimens of her
penetration. The first quotation we make will undoubtedly cause as
much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> surprise to the very many benevolent associations in
Boston (which are constantly deploring their inability to meet the
voices of distress which cry, help us!), as it did to ourself:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I never met a beggar in Boston, not even among the Irish, and ladies
have told me that <em>they could not find a family on which to exercise
their benevolent feelings</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Governor Seymour, Miss Murray&#8217;s friend, will doubtless feel flattered by
the following patronizing mention of him. And here we will say, that it
would have been more politic in the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr> Miss Amelia, when we consider
England&#8217;s late relations to Sebastopol, had she omitted to touch upon so
ticklish a subject as British military discipline.</p>

<p class="new_para">Speaking of Governor Seymour&#8217;s review of the New York troops, on
Evacuation Day, she says:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Governor Seymour reviewed these troops in front of the City Hall with
as much tranquillity of manner and simple dignity <em>as might have been
evinced by one of the most experienced of <strong>our</strong> public men</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">One more instance of Miss Murray&#8217;s superior powers of observation:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I have found out the reason why ladies, traveling alone in the United
States, must be extravagantly dressed; without that precaution they meet
with no attention, and little civility, decidedly much less than in any
other country, so here it is not as <em>women</em>, but as ladies, they are
cared for, and this in Democratic America!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">In the first place, every body but Miss Murray knows that an American
<strong>lady</strong> never &ldquo;travels expensively dressed.&rdquo; That there are females who do
this, just as they walk our streets in a similar attire, and for a
similar purpose, is undeniable; and that they receive from the opposite
sex the &ldquo;attentions&rdquo; which they seek, is also true; but this, it seems
to us, should hardly <em>disturb the serenity of a &ldquo;Maid of Honor</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">As an American woman, and proud of our birth-right, we resent from our
British sister her imputation upon the proverbial chivalry of American
gentlemen. We have traveled alone, and in threadbare garments, and we
have never found these garments non-conductors of the respectful
courtesy of American gentlemen; they have never prevented the coveted
glass of water being proffered to our thirsty lips at the dépôt; the
offer of the more eligible seat on the shady side of the cars; the offer
of the beguiling newspaper, or book, or magazine; the kindly excluding
of annoying dust or sun by means of obstinate blinds or windows,
unmanageable by feminine fingers; the offer of camphor or cologne for
headache or faintness, or one, or all, of the thousand attentions to
which the chivalry of American gentlemen prompts them without regard to
externals, and too often (shame on the recipients!) without the reward
of the bright smile, or kindly &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; to which they are so surely
entitled.</p>

<p class="new_para">I could cite many instances in contradiction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> Miss Murray&#8217;s
assertion that it is &ldquo;not as <em>women</em> but as ladies,&rdquo; that American
gentlemen care for the gentler sex in America. I will mention only two,
out of many, which have come under my own personal observation.</p>

<p class="new_para">Every body in New York must have noticed the decrepit old woman, with
her basket of peanuts and apples, who sits on the steps near the corner
of Canal-street (for how long a period the oldest inhabitant only
knows). One day toward nightfall, when the execrable state of the
crossings almost defied petticoat-dom, I saw her slowly gather up her
decrepit limbs, and undiminished wares, and, leaning upon her stick,
slowly totter homeward. She reached the point where she wished to cross;
it was slippery, wet, and crowded with a Babel of carts and carriages.</p>

<p class="new_para">She looked despondingly up and down with her faded eyes, and I was about
to proffer her my assistance when a gentlemanly, handsome young man
stepped to her side, and drawing her withered hand within his arm,
safely guided her tottering footsteps across to the opposite sidewalk;
then, with a bow, graceful and reverential enough to have satisfied even
the cravings of the honorable and virginal Miss Murray, he left her. It
was a holy and a beautiful sight, and by no means an uncommon one,

<h2>A HOUSE WITHOUT A BABY.</h2>

<p class="new_para">There was not a child in the house, not one; I was sure of it, when I
first went in. Such a spick-and-span look as it had!
Chairs&mdash;grown-up chairs, plastered straight up against the wall;
books arranged by rule and compass; no dear little careless finger-marks
on furniture, doors, or window-glass; no hoop, or ball, or doll, or
mitten, or basket, or picture-book on the premises; not a pin, or a
shred on the angles and squares of the immaculate carpet; the tassels of
the window shades, at which baby-fingers always make such a dead set, as
fresh as if just from the upholsterer&#8217;s. I sat down at the well-polished
window, and looked across the street. At the upper window of a wooden
house opposite, I saw a little bald baby, tied into a high chair,
speculating upon the panorama in the street, while its little fat hands
frantically essayed to grab distant pedestrians on the sidewalk. Its
mother sat sewing diligently by its side. Happy woman! she has a baby!
She thought so, too; for by-and-by she threw down her work, untied the
fettering handkerchief, took the child from its prison-house, and
covered it with kisses. Ah! she had heard a step upon the
stairs&mdash;<em>the</em> step! And now there are <em>two</em> to kiss the baby; for
John has come to his dinner, and giving both mother and child a kiss
that made my lips work, he tosses the babe up in his strong arms, while
its mother puts dinner on the table.</p>

many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> great men of that time, and so many little men of this

<p class="new_para">Always an <em>if</em>! <em>If</em> the Philadelphians would not barricade their pretty
houses with those ugly wooden outside shutters, with those ugly iron
hinges. I am sure my gypsy breath would draw hard behind one. And <em>if</em>
the Philadelphians would not build such garrison-like walls about their
beautiful gardens. Why not allow the passer-by to view what would give
so much pleasure? certainly, we would hope, without abstracting any from
the proprietors. Clinton avenue, as well as other streets in Brooklyn,
is a beautiful example of this. Light, low iron railings about the
well-kept lawns and gardens&mdash;sunset groups of families upon
piazzas, and O&mdash;prettier yet&mdash;little children darting about
like butterflies among the flowers. I missed this in Philadelphia. The
balmy air of evening seemed only the signal for barring up each family
securely within those jail-like shutters; behind which, I am sure, beat
hearts as warm and friendly as any stranger could wish to meet, I must
say I feel grateful to any householder who philanthropically refreshes
the <em>public</em> eye with the vines and flowers he has wreathed about his
home. I feel grateful to any woman I meet, who rests my rainbow-sated

purse up your mouth at this? do you say it was not <em>proper</em> for me to
have said this? I hate the word proper. If you tell me a thing is not
proper, I immediately feel the most rabid desire to go &ldquo;neck and heels&rdquo;
into it. Proper! it is a fence behind which indelicacy is found hidden
much oftener than in the open highway. Out upon proper! So I say again,
I like to see a well-made man&mdash;made&mdash;not by the
tailor&mdash;but by the Almighty. I glory in his luxuriant beard; in his
firm step; in his deep, rich voice; in his bright, falcon eye. I thank
him for being handsome, and letting me see him. We all yearn for the
beautiful; the little child, who drew its first breath in a miserable
cellar, and has known no better home, has yet its cracked mug or
pitcher, with the treasured dandelion or clover blossoms. Be generous,
ye householders, who have the means to gratify a taste to which God
himself ministers, and hoard not your gardens and flowers for the palled
eye of satiety. Let the little child, who, God knows, has few flowers
enough in its earthly pathway, peep through the railing, and, if only
for a brief moment, dream of paradise.</p>

<p class="new_para">The Philadelphia Opera House, which I am told is a very fine one, I did

that locality. Upon my exit, I looked with new surprise upon the first

reverence with which his appearance had inspired me, we were about to
pass down the principal stairs to the main entrance, when he touched the
gentleman who accompanied me on the shoulder, and said in an undertone,
not intended for my ears, &ldquo;Please don&#8217;t offer me money, sir, <em>in the
presence of any one</em>!&rdquo; A minute after he had pocketed, with a bow, the
neatly-extracted coin (which <em>I</em> should as soon have thought of offering
to General Washington), and with a parting touch of his warning
forefinger to his lip, intended for my companion, we found ourselves
outside the building, doing justice to his generalship by explosive
bursts of laughter. So finished was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> performance, that we

grenadier-looking fellow, with a world of whisker, who, as I opened the

thumb and finger, as he inquired of me, &ldquo;Is this the item, mem?&rdquo; <em>Item!</em>
Had he searched the dictionary through, he could not have better hit

charged in my bill, as I had intended, but with it the whole cost of the

smashing the remainder&mdash;which I think of taking a special journey

<p class="new_para">One day, after my arrival in New York, I met a man striding down street,
in the face of a pin-and-needle wind, that was blowing his long hair
away from his bloodshot eyes, and forcing him to compress his lips, to
keep what breath he had&mdash;inside&mdash;to warm him; tall and lank,
he clutched his rough blanket shawl about him like a brigand. Fearing he
might be an escaped lunatic, I gave him a wide berth on the sidewalk.
Each day, in my walks, I met him, till at last I learned to watch for
the wearied, haggard-looking face; I think the demonism of it magnetized
me. After looking at the kidded dandies, who flourished their perfumed
handkerchiefs past, the sight of him was as refreshing as a grand, black
thunder cloud, looming up in the horizon, after the oppressive
hum-drum-ness of a sultry day. One night I was at the opera; and amid
its blaze, and glitter, and glare, was that haggard face, looking
tenfold more satanic than ever. Grisi charmed him not, nor Mario either.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah&mdash;that strain! who could resist it? A luminous smile in an

which, but one moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> ago, every passing hour had seemed to set
its seal of care, and sorrow, and disappointment?</p>

dissecting poor Napoleon (who certainly expiated all his sins, even that
wretched divorce, when he fretted his eagle soul away at St. Helena,
beating his strong, but powerless wings, heavily against his English
prison bars); when I read Mr. Fry&#8217;s vulture-like dissection of Napoleon,

a marvel of Lilliputianism, lightness, and lilacs. Raphael! what a face

<p class="new_para">While I speculated and wondered, she slowly lifted her kidded

scream at any minute after every seat in a street car is filled, and
every body is holding somebody in their laps; and somebody is treading
on every body&#8217;s toes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> the aisle; and every door and window is
shut; and onions and musk, and tobacco and jockey-club, and whisky, and
patchouli are mingling their sweets; and the unconscionable conductor
continues to beckon to misguided females upon the sidewalk, with whole
families of babies (every one of whom is sucking oranges or
sugar-candy), to crowd in, and add the last drop of agony to my brimming
cup.</p>

<p class="new_para">Yes, I think I may say I am nervous. I prefer, when the windows of an
omnibus are open, and the wind &ldquo;sets that way,&rdquo; that the driver should
not ex-spit-orate any oftener than is necessary. If the skirt of my
dress <em>must</em> be torn from my belt by hasty feet upon the sidewalk, I
prefer it to be done by a man&#8217;s boot rather than a woman&#8217;s
un-apologizing slipper; if the fringe of my mantle is foreordained &ldquo;to
catch,&rdquo; the gods grant it may be in a surtout button rather than on a
feminine watch-chain. If women shopkeepers were less lavish of cross
looks, and crossed sixpences, I might have more faith in the predicted
&ldquo;millennium.&rdquo; I don&#8217;t wish the Irish woman any harm who tortures me by
grinding on her accordeon in the cars, but, if I thought she had settled
her little reckoning with the priest, I should be happy to peruse her
obituary. I had rather not exchange a pleasant parlor circle for the
company of a huge bundle of &ldquo;proof, to be called for by seven o&#8217;clock
the next morning;&rdquo; and I had rather not have the pianos, in five
different houses near, each playing different tunes while I am revising
it. I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> wish to interfere with infant boys who are fond of
bonfires, but if they could make them of something beside dried leaves,
it would be a saving to my bronchial apparatus. If people who address me
would spell &ldquo;Fanny&rdquo; with two ns, I should be more likely to answer their
letters. If the little cherub, in jacket and trowsers, who blows the
organ of a Sunday, would stand behind a screen, it would materially
assist my devotions. If all the men in New York had as handsome a beard
as the editor of the &mdash;&mdash;, I would not object to see them
h&mdash;air &#8217;em. I should rather the New Yorker would not say that such
and such a paragraph would &ldquo;go all over,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;everywhere.&rdquo; I
should rather the Connecticuter, when he does not comprehend me, would
not startle me out of my chair with a sharp <em>Which?</em> I should rather the
Yankee would not say &ldquo;he was going to wash <em>him</em>,&rdquo; or speak of the &ldquo;back

<em>side</em> of the church.&rdquo; And, lastly, if all the people who are born with
seven fingers on one hand, or feet minus toes, or two noses, would not
select me in the street to inspect their monstrosities, my epitaph might
possibly be deferred a while longer.</p>

<h2>A WORD TO PARENTS AND TEACHERS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I have before me a simple but imploring letter from a little child,
begging me &ldquo;to write her a composition.&rdquo; I could number scores of such
which I have received. I allude to it for the sake of calling the
attention of parents and teachers to this cruel bugbear of childhood,
with which I can fully sympathize, although it never had terrors for me.
The multiplication table was the rock on which I was scholastically
wrecked; my total inability to ascertain &ldquo;if John had ten apples, and
Thomas took away three, how many John would have left,&rdquo; having often
caused me to wish that all the Johns in creation were&mdash;well, never
mind that, now. I have learned to like Johns since!</p>

<p class="new_para">But to return to the subject. Just so long as themes like &ldquo;The Nature of
Evil,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hydrostatics,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Moral Science,&rdquo; and kindred subjects, are
given out to poor bewildered children, to bite their nails and grit
their teeth over, while the ink dries on the nip of their upheld pens,
just so long will &ldquo;composition day&rdquo; dawn on them full of terrors. Such
themes are bad enough, but when you add the order to write three pages
at a mark, you simply invite them to diffuse unmeaning repetitions, as
subversive of good habits of composition as the command is tyrannical,
stupid, and ridiculous. You also tempt to duplicity, for a child,
cornered in this way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> has strong temptations to pass off for
its own what is the product of the brains of another; and this of
itself, as a matter of principle, should receive serious consideration
at the hands of these child-tormentors. A child should never be allowed,
much less <em>compelled</em> to write words without ideas. Never be guilty of
such a piece of stupidity as to return a child&#8217;s composition to him with
the remark, &ldquo;It is very good, but it is <em>too short</em>.&rdquo; If he has said all
he has to say, what more would you have? what more can you get but
repetition? Tell him to <em>stop when he gets through if it is at the end
of the first line</em>&mdash;a lesson which many an adult has yet to learn.</p>

<p class="new_para">In the first place, give a child no theme above his comprehension and
capacity; or, better still, allow him to make his own selection, and
always consider one line, intelligibly and concisely expressed, better
than pages of wordy bombast. In this way only can he be taught to write
well, sincerely, and fluently. Nature teaches you this: The little bird
at first takes but short flights to the nearest twig or tree. By-and-by,
as his strength and confidence grow, they are voluntarily and
pleasurably lengthened, till at last you can scarce follow him, as he
pierces the clouds. This forcing nature&mdash;pushing the little
fledgeling rudely out of the nest, can result only in total incapacity,
or, at best, but crippled flights. In the name of the children, I enter
my earnest protest against it, and beg teachers and parents to think of
and remedy this evil.</p>

Socrates, though it should rain tribulations all the rest of the day. If
I am to have but one glimpse of sunshine until nightfall, let it be
then. A plague on him or her who sits down to coffee (all hail coffee!)
with a doleful phiz. The witches fly away with that female who presents
herself in curl-papers, or introduces herself with a yawn. Unassoiled be
that grocer, who offends my proboscis with a doubtful egg; garroted be
that dairyman who waters my milk; kneaded be that fat podge of a baker
who is tardy with his hot rolls.</p>

it before me; and dream not, because my heart&#8217;s incense rises silently

<h2>GREENWOOD AND MOUNT AUBURN.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I have seen Greenwood. With Mount Auburn for my ideal of what a cemetery

<em>should</em> be, I was prepared for disappointment. But the two are not
comparable. Greenwood is the larger, and more indebted to the hand of
art; the gigantic trees of Mount Auburn are the growth of half a
century; but then Greenwood has its ocean view, which, paradoxical as it
may seem, is not to be overlooked. The entrance to Mount Auburn I think
the finer. Its tall army of stately pines stand guard over its silent
sleepers, and strew their fragrant leaves on the pathway, as if to
deaden the sound of the carriage wheels, which, at each revolution,
crush out their aromatic incense, sweet as the box of spikenard which
kneeling Mary broke at Jesus&#8217; feet.</p>

<p class="new_para">Greenwood has the greater monumental variety, attributable, perhaps
(more than to design), to the motley population of New York; the
proprietors of each tomb, or grave, carrying out their national ideas of
sepulture. This is an advantage. Mount Auburn sometimes wearies the eye
with its monumental monotony. Mount Auburn, too, <em>had</em> (for he long
since laid down in its lovely shade), a gray-haired old gate-keeper,
courteous and dignified: &ldquo;a man of sorrows,&rdquo; whose bald, uncovered head,
many will remember, who have stood waiting at the portal to bear in
their dead. Many a bouquet, simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> but sweet, of my favorite
flowers have I taken from his palsied hand; and many a sympathizing
look, treasured up in my heart from him whom Death had also bereft of
all. Greenwood has, at least if my afternoon visit was a fair exponent,
its jocund grave-diggers, who, with careless poise, and indecent foot,
of haste stumble on with the unvarnished coffin of the poor, and
exchange over the fresh and narrow mound, the comrade&#8217;s time-worn jest.
Money has its value, for it purchases gentler handling and better
manners.</p>

<p class="new_para">Let those who will, linger before the marble statue, or chiseled urn of
the rich; dearer to me is the grave of the poor man&#8217;s child, where the
tiny, half-worn shoe, is sad and fitting monument. Dearer to me, the
moldy toys, the whip, the cap, the doll, the faded locks of hair, on
which countless suns have risen and set, and countless showers have shed
their kindly tears. And yet for the infant army who slumber there, I can
not weep; for I bethink me of the weary toil and strife; the wrecks that
strew the life-coast; the plaint of the weary-hearted, unheard in life&#8217;s
fierce clamor; the remorseless, iron heel of strength, on the quivering
heart of weakness; the swift-winged, poisoned arrow of cruel slander;
the hearts that are near of kin as void of love; and I thank God that
the little shoes were laid aside, and the dreary path untrod.</p>

<p class="new_para">And yet, not all drear, for, as I pass along, I read, in graven lines,
of those who periled life to save life;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> who parted raging
billows and forked flames, at woman&#8217;s wild, despairing shriek, and
childhood&#8217;s helpless wail. Honor to such dauntless spirits, while there
are eyes to moisten and hearts to feel!</p>

<p class="new_para">Beautiful Greenwood! with thy feathery swaying willows, thy
silver-voiced fountains and glassy lakes: with thy grassy knolls and
shady dells; with thy &ldquo;Battle Hill,&rdquo; whose sod of yore was nourished by
brave men&#8217;s blood. The sailor here rests him well, in sound of old
Ocean&#8217;s roar; the fireman heeds nor booming bell, nor earthly trump, nor
hurried tramp of anxious feet; the pilot&#8217;s bark is moored and voyage
o&#8217;er; the school-boy&#8217;s lesson conned; beauty&#8217;s lid uncloses not, though
rarest flowers bloom above her; no husband&#8217;s hand is outstretched to her
who stoops with jealous care to pluck the obtrusive weed which hides the
name she, lonely, bears; no piping, bird-like voice, answers the
anguished cry, &ldquo;My child, my child!&rdquo; but, still the mourners come, and
sods fall dull and heavy on loved and loving hearts, and the busy spade
heeds never the dropping tears; and for her who writes, and for them who
read&mdash;ere long&mdash;tears in their turn shall fall. God help us
all.</p>

<h2>GETTING UP THE WRONG WAY.</h2>

<p class="new_para">It was an unlucky day; every body has known such. I got up just one hour
too late, and spent the whole day vainly trying to make it up. It was
useless. Things were predestined to go wrong. I felt it. Hooks and eyes,
strings and buttons were in the maddening conspiracy. Shoes and
stockings were mis-mated; there was a pin in the towel on which I wiped
my face; my hair-brush and comb had absconded, and my tooth-brush and
nail-brush had gone to keep them company. I ate a hurried breakfast,
salting my coffee and sugaring my beefsteak: for I recollected that I
had pressing business down town which required a cool head and punctual
feet. As I looked at my watch, I saw that it was already time that I was
on my way. I wound it up with a jerk, snapping the crystal, and
dislocating a spring. Now my boot laces knotted and twisted, and defied
every attempt to coerce them into duty; and what was worse, upon looking
for the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> (the product of hours and days of labor), I found that I had
burned it, in my absent state of mind, along with some waste paper! and
I recollected with agony how indifferently I had watched the last
sparkling fragment, as the hated wind merrily whistled it up the
chimney.</p>

<p class="new_para">I held my head for one distracted minute! Was it possible to recall it
as it was originally written?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> Even suppose I could? think of
all that lost labor (on heavenly days, too, when the pleasant sunlight
wooed me out-of-doors), and think of all that jog-trot punctuating to be
gone over again. For me, who <em>hate</em> stops&mdash;who believe only in an
exclamation point and a dash! I, who turn my back disdainfully upon an
interrogation point, who despise coal-on (save in January), who
religiously believe that a writer should no more be expected to fritter
away his brains on stupid stops, than that an artist should be required
to manufacture with his own hands the wooden frames used for his
pictures.</p>

<p class="new_para">Well, the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> was gone&mdash;stops and all&mdash;past praying for. I had
not even time to whine about it; I must go directly down town. I had the
misfortune to be boarding, so every drawer, closet, and cupboard must be
locked before starting; for locking one&#8217;s room door is a mere farce
while there are duplicate keys in the house. Yes, I locked them, and
unlocked them, too, twenty times or more, as I recollected some
handkerchief, collar or purse, which I had forgotten to take out.</p>

<p class="new_para">All right now, said I, dolorously, as I put the rattling keys in my
pocket, descended the interminable hotel stairs, and gained the street.
I had passed two blocks when I discovered that the pair of gloves I had
brought were both for one hand; the thermometer was at nipping point and
I had left my muff behind! I thrust one bare hand into my shawl,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> shut my teeth together, and
exclaimed, as I looked Fate full in the face&mdash;now, do your worst.</p>

<p class="new_para">And so it did!</p>

<p class="new_para">Down came the snow; had I taken my umbrella, not a flake would have
fallen; every body knows that. I looked at the omnibusses; they were all
full&mdash;full of great, lazy, black-coated men. I hate a black coat; I
don&#8217;t know why a man, unless he has received &ldquo;the right hand of
fellowship,&rdquo; should button himself up in one. Yes, there they sat, as
solemn as so many parsons, with their hats slouched over their faces,
thinking to save time (while they ruined their eye-sight) by reading the
morning papers as they joggled along to their offices. Meanwhile down
came the pitiless snow, as I plodded along. <em>Plodded</em>, for every
wheel-barrow, box, bale, cask, cart, and wagon, got purposely across my
track; and not for the life of me could I remember a sentence of that
ascension <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr></p>

<p class="new_para">I tried not to meet any body, but I met every body, and every body <strong>would</strong>
speak to me: beggars stopped me, country folks singled me out to inquire
the way&mdash;<em>me!</em> why <em>me?</em> with a street full of people? Did I direct
them wrong? Let them learn to ask somebody next time who does not mourn
a lost <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>; somebody whose life is not spent in locking up things and
losing the keys; somebody who is not required to write an article with a
stupid chambermaid flying in and out every ten minutes, leaving your
door ajar, whirling your papers across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> room, and scattering
your ideas to the remorseless winds; somebody whose meals are not

<em>always</em> not to be had, when type and printers wait for no woman.</p>

<p class="new_para">This is a digression. I reached the goal at last; simply and only
because one who keeps moving must inevitably fetch up somewhere. I
performed my errand, or thought I had, till I had got half-way home,
when I recollected an important fact omitted&mdash;<em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n&#8217;importe</span></em>. I was
desperate now. Guns and pistols could not have turned my steps back
again. How it blew! how it snowed! I did not hurry one step; I took a
savage pleasure in thinking of my spoiled bonnet-ribbon, wet feet, and
ice-ermined skirts. I even stopped, as I observed some umbrella-shielded
pedestrian looking wonderingly at me, and gazed with affected delight at
the miserable feminine kick-shaws in the shop windows, just to show my
sublime indifference to the warring elements.</p>

<p class="new_para">I reached my room, by dint of climbing the obnoxious stairs. I turned
the key, as I fondly hoped, on all my species.</p>

<p class="new_para">Rat, tat, rat, tat!</p>

She has a huge pile of clothes to be counted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> sorted, and
paid for, too! She dumps them down on the floor, just as if every minute
was not to me so much gold-dust until that <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> was resurrectionized. I
look around for my list of the clothes. It is not in the big dictionary,
no, nor in the Bible, no, nor in the pocket of my blue, red, gray,
green, or plaid dress.</p>

<p class="new_para">Bother! I exclaim, I can&#8217;t find it. I dare say you have them all right;
so I commence taking them out, and counting the pieces with an eye to
her pay. What&#8217;s that? A dickey, two shirts, and a vest! I hold them up
to the light with the tips of my fingers.</p>

squeezed this drop of comfort out of my misery&mdash;Thank heaven, I
have not to mend those clothes!</p>

<h2>FUNERAL NOTES.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Was there ever any thing like these insensate New Yorkers? Peep with me
into that undertaker&#8217;s shop, sandwiched between a millinery
establishment and an oyster saloon. See the coffins, Behemoth and
Lilliputian, pyramided in corners, spread out in rows, challenging in
platoons, on the sidewalk, the passers-by; while in the windows
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> corpse-caps, stiffly starched and plaited, with white
ribbon strings, ready to be tied under your chin, or mine.</p>

<p class="new_para">See the jolly owner, seated on a chair in the middle of his shop, with
his legs crossed, his hat on the back of his head, nonchalantly smoking,
with his children about his knee; as if the destroying angel had charge
to pass unvisited <em>his</em> blood-besprinkled door-post; as if eyes now
bright with hope were never to weep themselves dim over those narrow
houses.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now a customer comes in; a young man, whose swollen lids tell their own
sorrowful tale. The jolly undertaker, wide awake, throws away his cigar
stump, hands a chair to the new comer, exchanges a few words with him,
draws pencil and paper from his pocket, and <em>taking an infant&#8217;s coffin
into his lap for a writing desk</em>, commences scribbling down directions.
Meanwhile, a hearse rattles up to the door; none of your poor-house
hearses, in rusty black, with &ldquo;seedy&rdquo; driver, and hang-dog looking
horses; but a smart, sonsie, gay-looking New York turn-out&mdash;fit for
a turtle-consuming, turtle-consumed mayor; with nine huge ostrich
feathers, black and white, nodding patronizingly to the a-gape urchins,
who stand around the door, who are almost willing to get into a coffin
to have a ride with them&mdash;with two spanking white horses, equal to
Dan Rice&#8217;s &ldquo;Excelsior,&rdquo; with ostrich feathers in either ear, flowing as
their well-combed tails, which whisk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> gracefully over the black
velvet pall and trappings, as if Life were a holiday and Death its
Momus.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now the young man staggers out, shuddering as he passes the hearse, and
screening his swollen lids from curious gazers and the obtrusive
sunshine, to whom broken hearts are an every-day story. The jolly
undertaker rubs his hands, for death is busy and business is brisk. The
young man has made no bargain with him beforehand as to prices; how
could he? his heart was full of the widowed sister he left behind, and
her newly-made orphans; he only remarked, as he left the street and
number, &ldquo;to do what is customary;&rdquo; and custom requires that carriages
shall be provided for all the &ldquo;friends and acquaintances&rdquo; who may wish
to go. So &ldquo;friends and acquaintances&rdquo; gather (when the funeral hour
arrives). Why not? The day is fine and a ride to the out-of-town
cemetery pleasant, and (to them) inexpensive; they whose eyes scarce
rested with interest on the living form, gaze ceremoniously and
curiously on the dead; the widow&#8217;s tears are counted, the mourning
dresses of herself and children scrutinized; the prayer that always
falls so immeasurably short of what critical ears demand, is said; a
great silence&mdash;then a
rustling&mdash;bustling&mdash;whispering&mdash;then the coffin is borne
past the widow, who sees it through a mist of tears; and then the long

<h2>THE &ldquo;FAVORITE&rdquo; CHILD.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Why will parents use that expression? What right have you to have a

<em>favorite</em> child? The All-Father maketh his sun to shine alike upon the
daisy and the rose. Where would you be, were His care measured by your
merits or deserts? Is your child none the less your child, that nature
has denied him a fluent tongue, or forgotten her cunning, when, in
careless mood, she fashioned his limbs? Because beauty beams not from
the eye, is there no intelligence there? Because the rosy flush mantles
not the pale cheek, does the blood never tingle at your coldness or
neglect? Because the passive arms are not wound about your neck, has the
soul no passionate yearnings for parental love? O, how often does God,
more merciful than you, passing by the <em>Josephs</em> of your household,
stoop in his pity and touch those quivering lips with a live coal from
off the altar? How often does this neglected one, burst from out the
chrysalis in which your criminal coldness has enveloped him, and soaring
far above your wildest parental imaginings, compel from your ambition,
what he could not gain from your love?</p>

<p class="new_para">How often does he replenish with liberal hand the coffers which the
&ldquo;favorite child,&rdquo; in the selfishness which you fostered, has drained of
their last fraction. &ldquo;He that is first shall be last, and the last shall
be first.&rdquo; Let parents write this on their heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> tablets. Let
them remember it when they repulse the little clinging arms, or turn a
deaf ear to the childish tale of sorrow. O, gather up those clinging
tendrils of affection with gentlest touch; trample them not with the
foot of haste or insensibility rudely in the dust.</p>

<h2>A QUESTION, AND ITS ANSWER.</h2>

<p class="new_para">To Mary M., who desires a frank expression of opinion from the
undersigned, with regard to her marrying an old bachelor.</p>

<p class="new_para">Answer. Don&#8217;t do it. A man who for so long a period has had nobody but
himself to think of, who knows where the finest oysters and venison
steaks are to be found, and who has for years indulged in these and
every other little selfish inclination unchecked, will, you may be sure
(without punning), make a most miserable <em>help-meat</em>. When you have tea,
he will wish it were coffee; when you have coffee, he will wish it were
tea; when you have both, he will desire chocolate; and when you have
all, he will tell you that they are made much better at his favorite
restaurant. His shirts never will be ironed to suit him, his cravats
will be laid in the drawer the wrong way, and his pocket-handkerchiefs
marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> in the wrong corner. He will always be happy to wait
upon you, provided <em>your</em> way is his way; but an extra walk round a
block will put him out of humor for a week. He will be as unbending as a
church-steeple&mdash;as exacting as a Grand Turk, and as impossible to
please as a teething baby. Take my advice, Mary; give the old fossil the
mitten, and choose a male specimen who is in the transition state, and
capable of receiving impressions.</p>

<h2>WINTER.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Hoary-headed old Winter, I have had enough of you! Not that I shrink
from facing your rough breath, in a ten-mile walk, on the coldest day on
which you ever made icicles; for I am no fair-weather sailor, not I; I
have no thousand-dollar dress to spoil, and I am not afraid to increase
the dimensions of my ankle by a never-to-be-sufficiently-adored
India-rubber boot. I am dependent neither upon cars nor omnibusses,
though I am, like other mortals, sometimes brought up short for want of
a ferry-boat; but I am tired of frozen ground. I am tired of denuded
trees, and leafless vines and branches, scraping against walls and
fences, in the vain attempt to frictionize a little warmth into their
stiffened limbs. I am tired of gray skies, and the mournful wailing of
the winter wind; the stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> have a steel-like glitter, and the
moonbeams on the snow petrify me like the ghost of a smile on the face
of a wire-drawn old maid. I long, like a prisoned bird, for a flight
into green fields&mdash;I can not sing without the blossoming flowers. I
would go to sleep with them, nor wake till the soft spring sheds warm,
joyful tears, to call forth her hidden treasures.</p>

<p class="new_para">And yet, old Winter, I have liked thee less well than now; when the
hungry fire devoured the last remaining faggot, and Nature&#8217;s frozen face
was but typical of the faces that my adverse fortune had petrified; but
who cares for thee or them? So surely as prosperity brought back their
sycophantic smiles, so surely shall thy stiff neck be bowed before the
bounty-laden Spring. &ldquo;Hope on&mdash;hope ever;&rdquo; and yet how meaningless
fall these words upon the ear of the poor widow, who but a stone&#8217;s throw
from my window, sits watching beside her dead husband, heeding neither
the wailing cry of the babe at her breast, nor the wilder wail of the
winter wind, as it drifts the snow against the door.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Hope on&mdash;hope ever.&rdquo; She looks at you with a vacant stare, and
then at the lifeless form before her, as if that were her mute answer.
You tell her to trust in God, when it is her bitterest sorrow that the
voice of her rebellious heart is, &ldquo;Ye have taken away my idol, and what
have I left?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Left?&rdquo; poor mourner. O, so much, that you can not see until those
falling tears have cleared your vision and eased your pain. &ldquo;Left?&rdquo;
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> sweet memory of unclouded earthly love, of which not even
death can rob you; tones and looks which you will count over, when no
human eye sees you, as the miser tells his hoarded gold.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Left?&rdquo; his child and yours, who, with the blessed baptism of holy
tears, you will call God&#8217;s. &ldquo;Left?&rdquo; O, many a household, whose inmates
pressing their anguished brows under <em>living</em> sorrows, would bless God
for the sweet memories of earthly love that you cling to in your pain.
&ldquo;Left?&rdquo; tearful mourner; a crown to win, sweeter for the wearing, when
thorns have pressed the brow.</p>

<h2>A GAUNTLET FOR THE MEN.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I maintain it: all the heroism of the present day is to be found among
women. I say it to your beards. I am sick of such remarks as these:
&ldquo;Poor fellow! he was unfortunate in business, and so he<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> took to drinking;&rdquo; or&mdash;&ldquo;poor
fellow! he had a bad wife, and lost all heart.&rdquo; What does a <em>woman</em> do
who is unfortunate in business, I would like to know? Why&mdash;she
tries again, of course, and keeps on trying to the end of the chapter,
notwithstanding the pitiful remuneration man bestows upon her labor,
notwithstanding his oft-repeated attempts to cheat her out of it when
she has earned it! What does a woman do, who has a bad, improvident
husband? Works all the harder, to be sure, to make up his deficiencies
to her household; works day and night; smiles when her heart and back
are both breaking; speaks hopeful words when her very soul is dying
within her; denies herself the needed morsel to increase her children&#8217;s
portion, and crushed neither by the iron gripe of poverty, nor allured
by the Judas-smile of temptation, hopefully puts her trust in Him who
feedeth the sparrows.</p>

<p class="new_para">She &ldquo;the weaker sex?&rdquo; Out on your pusillanimous manhood! &ldquo;Took to
drinking because he was unhappy!&rdquo;
Bless&mdash;his&mdash;big&mdash;Spartan&mdash;soul! How I admire him!
Couldn&#8217;t live a minute without he had every thing to his mind; never had
the slightest idea of walking round an obstacle, or jumping over it;
never practiced that sort of philosophical gymnastics&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
grit his teeth at fate, and defy it to do its worst, because they
chattered so;&mdash;poor fellow! Wanted buttered toast, and had to eat
dry bread; liked &ldquo;2.40,&rdquo; and had to go a-foot; fond of wine, and had to
drink Croton; couldn&#8217;t smoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> though his stove-pipe did; rushed
out of the world, and left his wife and children to battle with the fate
that his coward soul was afraid to meet. Brave, magnanimous fellow!</p>

<p class="new_para">Again&mdash;we are constantly hearing that the extravagance of
women debars young men from the bliss of matrimony. Poor things! they
can&#8217;t select a wife <em>from out</em> the frivolous circle of fashion; there
are no refined, well-educated, lady-like, practical girls and women,
whom any man, with a man&#8217;s soul, might be proud to call wife, nobly
struggling for an honest maintenance as writers, governesses, teachers,
semptresses, and milliners. They never read such an advertisement as
this in the papers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Wanted, by a young girl, a situation as governess. She can teach the
English branches, French and Italian; and is willing to accept a small
remuneration, to secure a respectable home.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="new_para">Fudge! None so blind as they who <em>won&#8217;t</em> see. The truth is, most of the
young men of the present day are selfish to the backbone. &ldquo;Poor,&rdquo;
too&mdash;very poor!&mdash;never go to Shelby&#8217;s or Delmonico&#8217;s for a
nice little game supper, washed down with champagne at $2 a bottle;
never smoke dozens of cigars a day, at six cents a piece; never
invite&mdash;<em>themselves</em> to go to concerts, the opera, or the theater!
Wish they could afford to get married, but can&#8217;t, at least not till, as
they elegantly express it, &ldquo;they meet a pretty girl who has the tin.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SOLILOQUY OF A LITERARY HOUSEKEEPER.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Spring cleaning!&rdquo; Oh misery! Ceilings to be whitewashed, walls to be
cleaned, paint to be scoured, carpets to be taken up, shaken, and put
down again; scrubbing women, painters, and whitewashers, all engaged for
months a-head, or beginning on your house to secure the job, and then
running off a day to somebody else&#8217;s to secure another. Yes, spring
cleaning to be done; closets, bags, and baskets to be disemboweled; furs
and woolens to be packed away; children&#8217;s last summer clothes to be
inspected (not a garment that will fit&mdash;all grown up like Jack&#8217;s
bean-stalk); spring cleaning, sure enough. I might spring my feet off
and not get all that done. When is that book of mine to get written, I&#8217;d
like to know? It&#8217;s Ma&#8217;am, will you have this? and Ma&#8217;am, will you have
that? and Ma&#8217;am, will you have the other thing? May I be kissed if I
hadn&#8217;t more time to write when I lived in an attic on salt and potatoes,
and scrubbed the floor myself. Must I turn my house topsy-turvy, and
inside out, once a year, because my grandmother did, and send my MSS.
flying to the four winds, for this traditionary &ldquo;spring cleaning.&rdquo;
Spring fiddlestick! Must I buy up all Broadway to be made into dresses,
because all New York women go fashion-mad? What&#8217;s the use of having a
house, if you can&#8217;t do as you like in it? What&#8217;s the use of being an
authoress, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> can&#8217;t indulge in the luxury of a shabby
bonnet, or a comfortable old dress? What&#8217;s the use of dressing when your
cook can outshine you? What is the use of dragging brocade and velvet
through ferry-boats and omnibusses, to serve as mats for market-baskets
and dirty boots? &ldquo;There goes Lily Larkspur, the authoress, in that
everlasting old black silk.&rdquo; Well&mdash;what&#8217;s the use of being well
off, if you can&#8217;t wear old clothes. If I was poor, as I was once, I
couldn&#8217;t afford it. Do you suppose I&#8217;m going to wrinkle up my face,
scowling at unhappy little boys for treading on a five-hundred-dollar
silk? or fret myself into a fever because some <em>gentleman</em> throws a
cigar-stump on its lustrous trailing folds? no, no; life is too short
for that, and much too earnest. Give me good health&mdash;the morning
for writing, and no interruptions, plenty of fresh air afterwards, and
an old gown to enjoy it in, and you may mince along in your peacock
dry-goods till your soul is as shriveled as your body.</p>

<h2>A BREAKFAST-TABLE REVERIE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I looked up&mdash;they were laughing at me&mdash;I am accustomed to be
laughed at&mdash;so it neither moved nor astonished me. They had been
laughing because I had been reading so long, and so intently, the
advertising page of my daily paper. And why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> not? when it is
often to me the most interesting part of it. To be sure, I look at it
with a pair of eyes that have not always been undimmed with tears; I
think sometimes of the unwritten tragedy there may be in a four-line
advertisement which scarce arrests the careless, laughing eye. I think
of the days and nights of misery it took, the suffering and privation,
to goad the sensitive heart up to its first appeal to the public
ear&mdash;the trembling fingers which may have penned it&mdash;the tears
which well-nigh obliterated it&mdash;the leaden feet which bore it,
almost helplessly, to its destination.</p>

<p class="new_para">No, I was not vexed that they laughed at me, for how should they, whose
life-path had been always flower-bestrown, think of these sad things?</p>

<p class="new_para">I had been reading what follows. Listen</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;A young lady, suddenly thrown upon her own resources for support,
desires a situation as Governess. She can teach all the English
branches, understands French, German, and Italian, and would be willing
to accept even the smallest compensation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="new_para">I saw her! homeless&mdash;friendless&mdash;heart-broken; willing to
accept the most humiliating, grinding conditions for a safe and

<em>immediate</em> shelter for her innocence. I saw the cold, calculating eye
of some lady fashionist fasten upon the touching appeal. I saw her place
the young girl&#8217;s pressing necessities in one scale, and her avarice in
the other. I saw her include, in her acceptance of the post of
governess, that of lace-laundress and nursery-maid; and I saw the poor
young creature meekly, even thankfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> accept the conditions,
while her wealthy patroness questioned her qualifications, depreciated
her services, and secretly rejoiced at securing such a prize, at such an
economical rate of compensation.</p>

<p class="new_para">I saw another young girl similarly situated, but even less fortunate
than the one of whom I have spoken. I saw the libidinous eye of a wretch
who reads the advertising sheet with an eye to &ldquo;young governesses,&rdquo;
fasten upon her advertisement. I saw him engage her, as he has others,
for some fictitious family, in some fictitious place, constituting
himself the head of it, and her escort on the way&mdash;only to turn,
alas! her sweet innocent trust into the bitter channel of a life-long
and unavailing remorse.</p>

<p class="new_para">I took up the paper and read again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Who wants a boy?&mdash;A widower, with six children, will dispose of an
infant to some family inclined to receive it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="new_para">That a widower might possibly be so situated as to render such a measure
necessary, I could conceive, but that a <em>father</em> could pen such a
brusque, hilarious, jocular&mdash;&ldquo;<em>halloa-there</em>&rdquo;&mdash;announcement of
the fact, rather stunned me.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Who wants a boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">As if it were a colt, or a calf, or a six-weeks young pup&mdash;or any
thing under heaven but his own flesh and blood! as if the little
innocent had never lain beneath the loving heart of <em>her</em> whose last
throb was for its sweet helplessness&mdash;last prayer for its vailed
future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">Shade of the mother hover over that child!</p>

<p class="new_para">I read again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Information wanted of a little girl, who, at the age of five years, was
placed, ten years ago, in &mdash;&mdash; alms-house.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="new_para">I thought of <em>her</em> cheerless childhood (as I looked around my own bright
hearthstone at my own happy children). I saw <em>her</em> yearning vainly for
the sweet ties of kindred. I followed her from thence out into the
world, where all <em>but</em> herself, even the humblest, seem to have some
human tie to make life sweet; I saw her wandering hither and thither,
like Noah&#8217;s weary dove, without finding the heart&#8217;s resting-place;
wondering, when she had time to wonder (for the heavy burden of daily
toil which her slender shoulders bent beneath), if one heart yet beats
on God&#8217;s green earth, through which her own life-tide flows.</p>

<p class="new_para">I think of this&mdash;I wonder <em>who</em> it is who &ldquo;wants information&rdquo;
concerning her. I wonder is it some remorseful relative, some brother,
some sister, some father whose heart is at length touched with pity for
the unrecognized little exile&mdash;ay&mdash;such things have been!</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Clerks out of employment.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="new_para">Need it be? With acres of fertile earth lying fair in the broad

<p class="new_para">Then I read of starving seamstresses, with no stock in trade but their
needle; nothing but that too often, God help them! between their souls
and perdition; and, then, in the very face of my womanly instincts, I
say, <em>let</em> them lecture&mdash;<em>let</em> them preach&mdash;let them even be
doctors, if they will (provided they keep their hands off me!)</p>

<p class="new_para">Then I read, alas! advertisements, which promise youth and purity to
lead them through the scorching fires of sin unharmed, unscathed, which
say that the penalty annexed by a just God to his violated laws (even in
this world), <em>they</em> will turn aside; that a man <em>can</em> take fire into his
bosom and <em>not</em> be burned. And then I think that the editor who for
paltry gain, throws such firebrands into pure and happy homes <em>should
look well that the blight fall not on his own</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">But there is comedy as well as tragedy in an advertising sheet. I am
fond of poetry; my eye catches a favorite extract from Longfellow, or
Bryant, or Percival, or Morris; I read it over with renewed pleasure,
blessing the author in my heart the while. I am decoyed into the
building to which it serves as a fairy vestibule. Where do I find
myself?</p>

<h2>A GLANCE AT A CHAMELEON SUBJECT.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Tell you what are the fashions?&rdquo; I, who am sick of the very word
fashion? who could shake hands with every rustic I meet, for very
delight at his napless hat, and ark-like coat?</p>

<p class="new_para">You should be surfeited, as I am, with harlequin costumes; disgusted, as
I am, with troops of women, strutting, like peacocks, to show their
plumage; but who, less sensible than peacocks, never <em>shed their
feathers</em>. You should see brocades, and silk velvets, fit only for
carriage or dinner dresses, daily mopping up the tobacco pools on these
unmitigatedly nasty sidewalks. You should see the gay little bonnets,
and oh! you should see the vapid, expression-less, soul-less faces
beneath them. You should see the carriages, with their liveried
servants, in our republican streets, and the faces, seamed with <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></em>
and discontent, which peer through the windows, from beneath folds of
lace and satin.</p>

<p class="new_para">You should see how this dress furore infects every class and circle. You
should see the young apprentice girl who can afford but one bonnet,
buying a flimsy dress-hat, to be worn in all weathers; securing for
Sunday, a showy silk dress and gilt bracelet, when she has hardly a
decent chemise, or petticoat, and owns, perhaps, but one handkerchief,
and a couple of pairs of stockings. You should see the wife of the young
mechanic, with her embroid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ered pocket-handkerchief, and
flaunting pink parasol, while she can number but one pair of sheets, and
one table-cloth. You should see her children, with their plumed hats,
while parti-colored, dilapidated petticoats peep from beneath their
dresses, and they are shivering for the want of warm flannels. You
should see the servant-girl, with her greasy flounces, and soiled
artificial flowers. You should see young men, with staring diamond pins
stuck on their coarse shirt-bosoms, with shabby velvet vests, and mock
chains looped over them.</p>

<p class="new_para">You should go into the &ldquo;furnishing stores for ladies&#8217; and children&#8217;s
garments;&rdquo; and see how <em>impossible</em> it is to find <em>plain</em>, <em>substantial</em>
articles of clothing <em>for either</em>&mdash;two thirds, at least, of the
cost of every article being for elaborate trimming, and ruffling, and
useless embroidery. You should go into the &ldquo;ladies&#8217; cloak stores,&rdquo; and
see these garments loaded indeed with gay trimmings, but miserably thin,
and ill-adapted for winter wear; hence the <em>stories</em> of garments you
frequently notice on New York ladies (as winter intensifies), as if one
good, sensible, thickly-wadded, old-fashioned, outside garment, could,
by any possibility, be more awkward and ugly than such an &ldquo;arrangement,&rdquo;

dozen yards of ribbon ditto, lace ditto. Secure them, for a bonnet, to
your bump of amativeness, with two long pins. Then sprinkle the contents

<h2>FACTS FOR UNJUST CRITICS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">A few scraps from the &ldquo;Life of Charlotte Bronte,&rdquo; that I would like to
see pasted up in editorial offices throughout the length and breadth of
the land:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;She, Miss Bronte, especially disliked the lowering of the standard by
which to judge a work of fiction if it proceeded from a feminine pen;
and praise, <span class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Originally &ldquo;mingled wth&rdquo;">mingled with</span> pseudo-gallant allusions to her sex, mortified
her far more than actual blame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Come what will,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I can not, when I write, think always of
myself, and of what is elegant and charming in femininity; it is not on
these terms, or with such ideas, that I ever took pen in hand, and if it
is only on these terms my writing will be tolerated, I shall pass away
from the public and trouble it no more.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;I wish all reviewers believed me to be a man; they would be more just
to me. They will, I know, keep measuring me by some standard of what
they deem becoming to my sex; where I am not what they consider
graceful, they will condemn me.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;No matter&mdash;whether known or unknown&mdash;misjudged or the
contrary&mdash;I am resolved not to write otherwise. <em>I shall bend as my
powers tend.</em> The two human beings who understood me are gone; I have
some who love me yet, and whom I love, without expecting or having a
right to expect they shall perfectly understand me. I am satisfied, <em>but
I must have my own way in the matter of writing</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Speaking of some attacks on Miss Bronte, her biographer says:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Flippancy takes a graver name, when directed against an author by an
anonymous writer; we then call it <em>cowardly insolence</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">She also says:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is well that the thoughtless critics, who spoke of the sad and
gloomy views of life presented by the Brontes in their tales, should
know how such words were wrung out of them by the living recol<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>lection of the long agony they
suffered. It is well, too, that they who have objected to the
representation of <em>coarseness, and shrank from it with repugnance, as if
such conception arose out of the writers, should learn, that not from
the imagination, not from internal conception&mdash;but from the hard
cruel facts, pressed down, by an external life upon their very senses,
for long months and years together, did they write out what they saw,
obeying the stern dictates of their consciences</em>. They might be
mistaken. They might err in writing at all, when their afflictions were
so great that they could not write otherwise than as they did of life.
It is possible that it would have been better to have described good and
pleasant people, doing only good and pleasant things (<em>in which case
they could hardly have written at any time</em>): all I say is, that never,
I believe, did women possessed of such wonderful gifts exercise them
with a fuller feeling of responsibility for their use.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">A friend of Miss Bronte says:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;The world heartily, greedily enjoyed the fruits of Miss Bronte&#8217;s
labors, <em>and then found out she was much to blame for possessing such
faculties</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Mrs. Gaskell says:</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;So utterly unconscious was Miss Bronte of what was by some esteemed
&lsquo;<em>coarse</em>&rsquo; in her writings, that on one occasion, when the conversation
turned upon women&#8217;s writing fiction&mdash;she said, in her grave,
earnest way, &lsquo;I hope God will take away from me whatever power of
invention, or expres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>sion I may have, before he lets me become
blind to the sense of what is fitting, or unfitting to be said.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">Fanny Fern says:</p>

<p class="new_para">I would that all who critically finger women&#8217;s books, would read and
ponder these extracts. I would that reviewers had a more fitting sense
of their responsibility, in giving their verdicts to the public;
permitting themselves to be swayed neither by personal friendship, nor
private pique; speaking <em>honestly</em>, by all means, but remembering their
own sisters, when they would point a flippant, smart article <em>by
disrespectful mention of a lady writer; or by an unmanly, brutal
persistence in tearing from her face the mask of incognito-ship, which
she has, if she pleases, an undoubted right to wear</em>. I would that they
would speak respectfully of those whose pure, self-denying life, has
been through trials and temptations under which <em>their</em> strong natures
would have succumbed; and who tremblingly await the public issue of days
and nights of single-handed, single-hearted weariness and toil. Not that
a woman&#8217;s book should be praised because it is a woman&#8217;s, nor, on the
contrary, condemned for that reason. But as you would shrink from seeing
a ruffian&#8217;s hand laid upon your sister&#8217;s gentle shoulder, deal honestly,
but, I pray you, <em>courteously</em>, with those whose necessities have forced
them out from the blessed shelter of the home circle, into jostling
contact with rougher natures.</p>

<h2>FAIR PLAY.<br />

<span class="sub_head">OR, BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY.</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; said a lady to me, not long since, &ldquo;it is too bad; I am
almost tired to death.&rdquo; She had been to York on a shopping expedition;
and, having finished her purchases, and returned, laden with them to the
ferry, found two thirds of the seats in the <em>ladies&#8217; cabin</em> of the
ferry-boat occupied by <em>men</em>, while she and several other ladies were
compelled to stand till the boat reached the pier. &ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; she
repeated; &ldquo;they have no right to occupy the <em>ladies&#8217;</em> cabin, when ladies
are standing. Give them a dig, Fanny, won&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the case, to my mind, is clearly against
the coat-tails; more especially, as, when the boat touches the pier,
they rush past the ladies, and by right of their pantaloons leap over
the chain (which femininity must wait to see unhooked), in order to
monopolize all the seats in the street cars, to the exclusion of the
aforesaid dismayed and weary ladies. Most certainly I will give them a
dig, my dear; it is an exhibition of &lsquo;grab&rsquo; which is quite disgusting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="new_para">But stay&mdash;have the <em>ladies</em> no sins to answer for? May it not be
just possible that the men are at last getting weary of rendering
civilities to women who receive them as a matter of right, without even
an acknowledging smile, or &ldquo;Thank you?&rdquo; May they not have tired of
creeping, with an abject air, into cars and omnibusses, and gradually
and circumspectly lowering themselves amid such billows of hoops and
flounces? May they not at last have become disgusted at the absurd
selfishness which ladies manifest on these occasions? the &ldquo;sit closer,
ladies,&rdquo; of the conductors and drivers being met with a pouting frown,
or, at best, the emigration of the sixteenth part of an inch to the
right or left. And is it not a shame, that a deprecating blush should
crimson a gentleman&#8217;s forehead because he ventures to seat himself, in a
public conveyance, in the proximity of these abominable,
limb-disguising, uncomfortable, monopolizing hoops? Women who are
blessed with hips, should most certainly discard these<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> nuisances, and women who are not,
should know that narrow shoulders, and a bolster conformation, look more
ramrod-y still, in contrast with this artificial voluminousness of the

<p class="new_para">And then the little girls! The idea of hunting under these humbugs of

circumscribed, their graceful limbs hidden, and their gleeful sports
checked&mdash;the monstrosity of making hideous <em>their</em> perfect
proportions, and rendering them a laughing-stock to every jeering boy
whom they meet; and&mdash;worse than all&mdash;the <em>irreparable moral

Fashion! Bah!&mdash;I have no patience to think of it. I turn my pained

disgusting, that women have not fortitude sufficient to discard the
universal and absurd custom of wearing hoops. Nay, more, I affirm that

<h2>MATRIMONIAL ADVERTISEMENTS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">That prurient young men, and broken-down old ones, should seek amusement
in matrimonial advertisements, is not so much a matter of surprise; but
that respectable papers should lend such a voice in their columns, is, I
confess, astonishing. I do not say that a virtuous woman has never
answered such an advertisement; but I do say, that the virtue of a woman
who would do so is not invincible. There is no necessity for an
attractive, or, to use a hateful phrase, a &ldquo;marketable&rdquo; woman, to take
such a degrading step to obtain what, alas! under legitimate
circumstances, often proves, when secured, but a Dead Sea apple. It is
undesirable, damaged, and unsaleable goods that are oftenest offered at
auction. A woman must first have ignored the sweetest attributes of
womanhood, have overstepped the last barrier of self-respect, who would
parley with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> stranger on such a topic. You tell me that
marriage has sometimes been the result. Granted: but has a woman who has
effected it in this way, bettered her condition, how uncongenial soever
it might have been? Few husbands (and the longer I observe, the more I
am convinced of the truth of what I am about say, and I make no
exception in favor of education or station) have the magnanimity to use
justly, generously, the power which the law puts in their hands. But
what if a wife&#8217;s helplessness be aggravated by the reflection that she
has <em>abjectly solicited</em> her wretched fate? How many men, think you, are
there, who, when out of humor, would hesitate tauntingly to use this
drawn sword which you have foolishly placed in their hands?</p>

<p class="new_para">Our sex has need of all the barriers, all the defenses, which nature has
given us. No&mdash;never let woman be the wooer, save as the flowers

<h2>A SABLE SUBJECT.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Every day, in my walks, I pass a large bow window on the corner of two
streets, in which is displayed the agreeable spectacle of big and little
coffins of all sorts and shapes, piled up and standing on end. This is
in bad taste enough; but yester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>day, through the ostentatious
glass-windows of the shop, I saw a little rosy baby crawling over and
around them, while the elder children were using them for play-houses
for their dolls! Now such a sight may strike other people agreeably, or
they may pass it every day with entire indifference; unfortunately for
my peace of mind, I can do neither one nor the other, for by a sort of
horrid fascination my eyes are attracted to that detestable window, and
familiarity but increases my disgust.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now I know I shall need a coffin some day or other; but to-day the blue
sky arches over my head, the fresh wind fans my temples, and every blade
of grass, and new-blown violet, makes me childishly happy; now what
right has that ghoul of an undertaker to nudge me in my healthy ribs as
I pass, check my springing step, send the blood from my cheek back to my
heart, change my singing to sighing, and turn this bright glorious earth
into one vast charnel-house? In the name of cheerfulness, I indict him,
and his co-fellows, for unmitigated nuisances.</p>

<p class="new_para">And while I am upon this subject I would like to ask why the New York
sextons, for I believe it is peculiar to them, should have the exclusive
privilege of advertising their business on the outer church-walls, any
more than the silversmith who furnishes the communion-plate; or the
upholsterer who makes the pulpit and pew-cushions; or the bookseller who
furnishes the hymn-books; or the dry-goods mer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>chant who sells
the black silk to make the clergyman&#8217;s robe? It strikes me that it is a
monopoly, and a very repulsive one. In my opinion, this whole funeral
business needs reforming. Much of the shrinking horror with which death
is invested even to good Christians, is traceable to these repulsive,
early associations, of which they can not, by any exercise of faith, rid
themselves in after years. These unnecessary, ostentatious,
long-drawn-out paraphernalia of woe; these gloomy sable garments, which
all should unite in abolishing; these horrible pompous funerals, with
their pompous undertakers, where people who scarce ever glanced at the
living face congregate to sniffle hypocritical tears over the dead one;
these stereotyped round-about prayers that mean so little, and which the
mourner never hears; this public counting of scalding tears by careless
gazers at the grave-yard or the tomb; it is all horrible&mdash;it need
not be&mdash;for the sake of childhood, often, through fear of death,
all its life-time subject to bondage, it <em>ought not</em> to be. Even the
&ldquo;heathen,&rdquo; so called, have the advantage of us in the cheerfulness with
which they wisely invest a transition, from which flesh and blood, with
its imperfect spiritualization, instinctively shrinks.</p>

a more humble but much more useful portion of the community are rubbing

lamps, and the gray dawn, to another brave day of ill-requited toil;
while in many an attic, by the glimmer of a handful of lighted shavings,
tear-stained faces resume the coarse garment left unfinished the night

<p class="new_para">I turned my head. Directly behind me, in Broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>way, was a
full-freighted omnibus. One of the horses attached had kicked out both
his hind legs, snapped the whiffle-tree to the winds, and planting his
hoofs into the end window, under the driver&#8217;s seat, had shivered the
glass in countless fragments, into the faces of the astonished
passengers, plunging and rearing with the most &#8217;76-y spirit. Ladies
screamed, and scrambled with what haste they might, out on to the
pavement; gentlemen dropped their morning papers, and uttering angry
imprecations as they brushed the glass splinters from their broadcloth,
followed them; while the driver cursed and lashed in vain at the
infuriated hoofs, which abated not a jot of their fury at all his
cursing and lashing.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Vicious beast!&rdquo; exclaimed one bystander. &ldquo;Ought to be shot

<em>instanter</em>!&rdquo; said a second. &ldquo;I&#8217;d like to lash his hide raw!&rdquo; exclaimed
a third Nero.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah! my good friends, thought I, as I went laughing on my way, not so
fast with your anathemas. The cause of that apparently malicious and
unprovoked attack, <em>dates a long way back</em>. Count, if you please, the
undeserved lashings, the goadings, and spurings, that noble creature has
borne, while doing a horse&#8217;s best to please! Think of the scanty feed,
the miserable stable, the badly-fiting, irritating harness; the
slippery pavements, where he has so often been whipped for stumbling;
the melting dog-days with their stinging bottle-flies and burning
sun-rays, when he has plodded wearily up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> those
interminable avenues, sweating and panting under the yoke of cruel
task-masters.</p>

<p class="new_para">&#8217;Tis the last ounce which breaks the camel&#8217;s back; &#8217;tis the last atom
which balances the undulating scales. Why should that noble horse bear
all this? He of the flashing eye, arching neck, and dilating nostril? He
of the horny hoof and sinewy limb? <em>He!</em>&mdash;good for a <em>score</em> of his
oppressors, if he would only think so!&mdash;<em>Up go his hoofs!</em> As a
Bunker Hill descendant, I can not call that horse&mdash;a jackass.</p>

<h2>AIRY COSTUMES.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Are the New York children to be frozen this winter, I want to know? Are
their legs to be bared from the knee to the tip of their little white
socks, just above the ankle, to please some foolish mother, who would
rather her child were a martyr to neuralgia and rheumatism, its natural
life, than to be out of fashion? Are sneezing babes to face the winter
wind in embroidered muslin caps, lined with silk, the costly lace
borders of which are supposed to atone for the premature loss of their
eye-sight? Are little girls to shiver in cambric pantalettes, and skirts
lifted high in the air by infantile hoops? Are their mothers to tiptoe
through the all-abounding &ldquo;slosh&rdquo; of New York streets, in paper-soled
gaiters, and rose-colored silk stockings? And yet one scarce<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>ly cares about the latter, because
the sooner such &ldquo;mothers of families&rdquo; tiptoe themselves into their
graves, the better for coming generations; but for the children, one can
but sigh, and shiver too; and inquire, as did an old-fashioned physician
of a little undressed victim, &ldquo;If cloth was so dear that her mother
could not afford to cover her knees?&rdquo; It is a comfort to look at the
men, who, whatever follies they may be guilty of (and no human
arithmetic can compute them), have yet sense enough to wear thick-soled
boots, and wadded wrappers in the proper season. One looks at their
comfortable garments and heaves a sigh for breeze and mud-defying
pantaloondom; for with the most sensible arrangements for skirts, they
are an unabated and intolerable nuisance in walking; and yet those
horrid Bloomers! those neutral, yet &ldquo;strong-minded&rdquo; Miss Nancys! with
their baggy stuff-trowsers, flaping fly-aways, and cork-screw
stringlets. I <em>could</em> get up a costume! but alas! the brass necessary to
wear it! I see now, with my mind&#8217;s eye, the jaunty little cap, the
well-fitting, graceful pants, the half-jacket, half-blouse&mdash;the
snow-white collar, and pretty fancy neck-tie&mdash;the ravishing
boot&mdash;the nicely fitting wrist-band, with its gold sleeve-buttons;
but why awake the jealousy of the other &ldquo;sect?&rdquo; Why drive the tailors to
commit suicide in the midst of their well-stocked warehouses? Why send
little boys grinning round corners? Why make the parson forget his
prayers, and the lawyer his clients?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> Why drive distracted the
feminine owners of big feet and thick ankles? Why force women to mend
the holes in the heels of their stockings? Why leave to scavengers the
pleasant task of mopping up dirty streets and sidewalks? Why drive &ldquo;M.
Ds.&rdquo; to take down their signs, and take up &ldquo;de shovel and de hoe?&rdquo; I&#8217;ll
be magnanimous. I won&#8217;t do it.</p>

<h2>A PEEP AT THE OPERA.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I was at the opera last night. It was all gas-glare, gilding and girls.
Oh, the unspeakably tiresome fix-up-ativeness of New York women! The
elaborate hair-twistings and braidings; the studied display of bracelets
and rings; the rolling-up of eyes, and casting-down of eye-lashes; the
simperings and smirkings; the gettings-up and sittings-down, ere the
fortunate attitude is fixed upon; the line at which a shawl must be
dropped to show a bust; the ermine sheets, worn without reference to
lily or leopard complexions; the fat damsels who affect Madonna-ism; the
lean women, whaleboned to &ldquo;Peter Schemel&rdquo;-ism; the tinsel-y
head-dresses; the gaudy opera-cloaks; the pray-do-look-at-me air; the
utter absence of simplicity, and of that beautiful self-forgetfulness
which is the greatest charm of woman. It is a relief to see some honest
country people stray in, simply cloaked and bon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>neted (and
old-fashioned and homely at that,) who, ignorant of the mighty
difference between &ldquo;point&rdquo; and cotton-lace, ermine and cat-skin, drop
into a seat, ignore their artificial neighbors, and lose themselves in
the illusions of the stage.</p>

<p class="new_para">Mark <strong>Grisi</strong>! What perfection of grace in attitude, what simplicity and
appropriateness in costume, what a regal head, what massive white
shoulders, what a queenly tread. How could such an imperial creature
ever love that effeminate little pocket-edition&mdash;<strong>Mario</strong>? A <em>pretty</em>
man! with his silky locks parted in the middle, and a little dot of an
imperial under his little red lip! Antidote me his effeminacy, oh
memory, with the recollection of Daniel Webster&#8217;s unfathomable eyes and
Lucifer-ish frown;&mdash;something grand&mdash;something
noble&mdash;something <em>homely</em> if you like, but for Heaven&#8217;s sake,
something <em>manly</em>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>HARD TIMES.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Is <em>me</em> velvet j-a-c-k-e-t ready to try on?&rdquo; drawled a lady, dropping
her elegant cashmere from one shoulder, as she sauntered into Mme.
&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s dress-making saloon.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; replied the young girl in waiting.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>Ve&#8217;y</em> extraordinary&mdash;<em>ve&#8217;y</em> surprising; madame promised it,
without fail, this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Madame has been unexpectedly called out,&rdquo; replied the girl, coolly
rehearsing the stereotyped fib.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;<em>Ve&#8217;y</em> perplexing,&rdquo; muttered the lady; &ldquo;<em>ve&#8217;y</em> ridiculous&mdash;pray,
when <em>will</em> she see me?&rdquo; she asked (unwilling to trust the draping of
her aristocratic limbs to less practiced hands).</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;This afternoon at five,&rdquo; answered the girl, fibbing a second time,
knowing very well that it was part of madame&#8217;s tactics to keep her
saloon daily filled with just such anxious expectants, up to the last
endurable point of procrastination. And there they sat, poor imbeciles!
grouped about the room, pulling over the last fashion prints,
overhauling gayly-colored paper dress patterns, discussing modes, robes,
basques, and trimmings, with the most ludicrously-grave earnestness,
ordering ruinous quantities of point lace and velvet, with the most
reckless abandon, and vying which should make themselves look most
hideously-Babylonish and rainbow-like; while their husbands and fathers,
in another part of the city, were hurrying from banks to
counting-houses, sweating and fretting over &ldquo;protested notes,&rdquo; care,
meanwhile, anticipating old Time in seaming their brows, and plowing
their cheeks with wrinkles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="new_para">In an unfashionable, obscure part of the city, in the basement of a
small two-story house, sat a woman of twenty-seven years, the mother of

<em>ten</em> children, who were swarming about her like a hive of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> bees&mdash;fat, clean, rosy,
noisy, merry, and happy. They had little space for their gymnastics, it
is true, the little room dignified as &ldquo;the parlor&rdquo; being only twelve
feet square; back of this was a dark bedroom, leading to a small
kitchen, filled with the usual variety of culinary utensils. The pot of
potatoes for their simple dinner, was boiling over the kitchen fire; the
happy mother of this little family was putting the last touches to a
silk dress for a lady in the neighborhood; and the baby was sleeping as
sweetly, as though its brothers and sisters were not using their lungs
and limbs, as God <em>intended</em> children&#8217;s lungs and limbs should be used.
On a small table in the corner lay a pile of medical books&mdash;for the
father of these ten children was absent at a medical lecture,
preparatory to a physician&#8217;s practice.</p>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;Poor George!&rdquo; said the prolific young mother, with a laugh&mdash;&ldquo;all
these big books yet to be crammed into his curly head; <span
class="correction" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Originally &ldquo;never mind&rdquo;">never
mind</span>&mdash;I had rather do all my own work, take in dress-making, and
support the family two years longer, than that he should be disappointed
in his favorite wish of becoming a doctor. There he comes!&rdquo; said she,
dropping her needle, as a dark-eyed, intelligent-looking, mercurial
little fellow bounced into the room&mdash;snatched the baby from the
cradle&mdash;jumped pell-mell into the laughing group of little boys and
girls, and kissed his wife&#8217;s forehead, as he helped her to draw out the
dinner-table.</p>

<p class="new_para">Ah, thought I, as I contrasted this with the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> at Madame
B&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s saloon, better is a dinner of potatoes where <em>love</em>
is, than a stalled ox and a protested note therewith!</p>

<h2>COUNTER IRRITATION.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&ldquo;That is all clerks are fit for,&rdquo; said a heartless woman, who had been
diverting herself with turning a store full of goods topsy-turvy.</p>

<p class="new_para">Is it?</p>

<p class="new_para">Is the situation of a clerk always a congenial one? Have those who
occupy it never a soul above ribbons and laces? Are they as frivolous,
and mindless as many of the ladies upon whom they are often obliged to
wait? Is their future bounded by the counter to which necessity has
chained them?</p>

<p class="new_para">Not at all.</p>

<p class="new_para">Look into our library reading-rooms of an evening. See them joining the
French, Spanish, German, and Italian classes. See them, unconscious of
the flight of time, devouring with avidity works of history, biography,
and books of travel. See the eye sparkle, and the brow flush, as they
read how a Greeley shut his teeth on discouragement, and hewed out with
his unaided arm a path to honor and usefulness. Ah! has the clerk no
noble, hopes or aspirations for the future, which the grinding,
treadmill round of his daily toil can neither smother nor crush<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> out? Is there no far-off home
from which he is an unwilling exile? No mother, no sister, whom he must
make proud of son and brother? No bright-eyed, winsome young girl, whose
image enshrined in his heart is at once a talisman against evil, and a
spur to unremitting exertion? the hope of whose love sweetens and
dignifies his unpretending labor, nerves him to bear uncomplainingly,
unresentfully, the overbearing and undeserved rebuke of arrogant
assumption?</p>

<p class="new_para">You shake your head, and cite sad instances to the contrary. You tell me
of dishonest, dissolute, improvident clerks, lost to every just,
generous, and noble feeling; who look not beyond the present hour either
for soul or body.</p>

<p class="new_para">True.</p>

<p class="new_para">But what if, when they entered upon their clerkship they stood alone in
the world, uncared for, irresponsible, held in check by no saving home
influences, adrift upon the great human life tide? What if their
employers looked upon them merely as tools and machines, not as human
beings? What if they ground them down to the lowest possible rate of
compensation. What if never by look, act, word, or tone, they manifested
a kindly parental interest in their future, cared not what company they
kept, or what influences surrounded them in their leisure hours? What if
these young men returned at night, after their day&#8217;s meagerly rewarded
toil, to a small, dreary, desolate, comfortless, lodging room,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> where there was nothing to cheer
the eye or rest the heart? What if the syren voice of sin softly
whispered those youthful, restless, craving hearts away?</p>

<p class="new_para">What then?</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh! if employers sometimes thought of this! Sometimes stopped the
Juggernaut wheels of Mammon to look at the victims which lay crushed
beneath, for want of a little human love, and care, and sympathy!
Sometimes thought, while looking with fond pride upon their own young
sons, that fortune&#8217;s wheel, in some of its thousand revolutions, might
whirl them through the same fiery ordeal, and that their now unclouded
sun might go down while it was yet day.</p>

<p class="new_para">You, who are employers, think of it!</p>

<p class="new_para">Youth hungers for appreciation&mdash;sympathy&mdash;must have
it&mdash;ought to have it&mdash;<em>will</em> have it. Oh, give it an
occasional thought whether the source from whence it is obtained be good
or evil, pure or impure! Speak kindly to them.</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, the saving power there is in feeling that there is one human being
who cares whether we stand or fall!</p>

<h2>SUNDAY IN GOTHAM.</h2>

<p class="new_para">&#8217;Tis Sabbath morning in Now York. You are wakened by children&#8217;s voices,
pitched in every variety of key, vying which shall shout the loudest:
&ldquo;Her&#8217;ld&mdash;<em>Dis</em>patch&mdash;Sun&#8217;y Times&mdash;Sunny
Atlas&rdquo;&mdash;parenthetized by an occasional street-fight between the
sturdy little merchants, when one encroaches on the other&#8217;s &ldquo;beat.&rdquo; You
have scarce recovered from their ear-splitting chorus, before the air is
rent by a sound like ten thousand Indian war-whoops, and an engine
thunders by, joined by every little ragamuffin whose legs are old enough
to follow. Close upon the heels of this comes the milk-man, who sits
philosophically on his cart, and glancing up at the windows, utters a
succession of sounds, the like of which never was heard in heaven above,
or earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now, saloons and cigar stores open half a shutter each, and apple-stalls
multiply at street corners. Then the bells ring for church, and, with
head and heart distracted, you obey the summons. On your way you pass
troops of people bound to Hoboken, Jersey, Williamsburg&mdash;anywhere,
but to the house of God. Groups of idle young men, with their best
beavers cocked over one eye, stand smoking and swearing at the street
corners; and now Yankee Doodle strikes on your ear, for the dead is left
to his dreamless sleep, and the world jogs on to a merrier measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">You enter the church porch. The portly sexton, with his thumbs in the
arm-holes of his vest, meets you at the door. He glances at you: your
hat and coat are new, so he graciously escorts you to an eligible seat
in the broad aisle. Close behind you follows a poor, meek, plainly-clad
seamstress, reprieved from her treadmill round, to think one day in
seven of the Immortal. The sexton is struck with a sudden blindness. She
stands one embarrassed moment, then, as the truth dawns upon her,
retraces her steps, and, with a crimson blush, recrosses the threshold,
which she had profaned with her plebeian foot.</p>

<p class="new_para">Now the worshipers one after another glide in; silks rustle; plumes
wave; satins glisten; diamonds glitter; and scores of forty-dollar
handkerchiefs shake out their perfumed odors.</p>

<p class="new_para">What an absurdity to preach the gospel of the lowly Nazarite to such a
set! The clergyman knows better than to do so. He values his fat salary
and his handsome parsonage too highly. So with a velvet-y tread he walks
round the ten commandments, places the downiest of pillows under the
dying profligate&#8217;s head, and ushers him with seraphic hymning into an
upper-ten heaven.</p>

<p class="new_para">From this disgusting farce let me take you to the lecture-room of the
Rev. Dr. Tyng. It is the first Sunday afternoon of the month (when he
regularly meets the children of his parish, who are mostly members of
his Sabbath-school). It would seem an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> easy thing to address a
company of children. Let him who thinks so, try it! Let him be familiar
without being flat; let him be instructive, and at the same time
entertaining; let him fix roving eyes; let him nail skittish ears; let
him stop just at the moment when a child&#8217;s mental appetite has lost its
digestive power. All this requires a&mdash;Dr. Tyng.</p>

<p class="new_para">See&mdash;group after group of bright faces gather around him, and take
their seats; not one is afraid of &ldquo;the minister.&rdquo; He has a smile of love
and a word of kindness for all. He has closed his church <em>purposely</em> to
meet them, and given the grown-folks to understand, that the soul of a
child is as priceless as an adult&#8217;s, and that he has a message from God
for each little one, as well as for father and mother and uncle John. He
asks some question aloud. Instantly a score of little voices hasten to
reply, as fearlessly as if they were by their own fire-side. He wishes
to fix some important idea in their mind: he illustrates it by an
anecdote, which straightway discloses rows of little pearly teeth about
him. He holds up no reproving finger when some lawless, gleeful little
two-year-older rings out a laugh musical as a robin&#8217;s carol. He calls on
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Susy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; with the most parental
familiarity and freedom. He asks <em>their opinion</em> on some point (children
like that!), he repeats little things they have said to him (<em>their</em>
minister has time to remember what even a little child says!) He takes
his hymn-book and reads a few sweet, simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> verses; he pitches
the tune <em>himself</em>, and, at a wave of his hand, the bright-eyed cherubs
join him.</p>

<p class="new_para">Look around. There is a little Fifth Avenue pet, glossy haired, velvet
skinned&mdash;her dainty limbs clad in silk and velvet. Close by her
side, sits a sturdy, freckled, red-fisted little Erin-ite, scantily clad
enough for November, but as happy, and as unconscious of the deficiency
as his tiny elbow neighbor; on the same seat is a little African, whose
shiny eye-balls and glittering teeth, say as plainly as if he gave
utterance to it, <em>we are all equal, all welcome here</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">Oh, <em>this</em> is Christianity&mdash;this is the Sabbath&mdash;this is
millennial. Look around that room, listen to those voices, if you can,
without a tear in your eye, a prayer in your heart, and Christ&#8217;s sweet
words upon your lips: &ldquo;<em>Feed my Lambs</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 title="ANNIVERSARY TIME.">ANNIVERSARY TIME.<br />

<span class="sub_head">MR. GOUGH AT THE OPERA HOUSE.</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">Funny, isn&#8217;t it? Country ministers, with their wives and daughters, in
the unhallowed precincts of an Opera House! I trust they crossed
themselves on the threshold, by way of exorcising Beelzebub. Observe
their furtive glances at the naked little dimplednesses perched upon
yonder wooden pillars. How legibly is&mdash;Saints and angels! where are
those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> children&#8217;s trowsers? written upon the elongated corners
of their evangelical mouths. R-a-t-h-e-r different, I confess, from the
Snagtown &ldquo;meetin&#8217;-house,&rdquo; with its slam-down seats, its swallow-nested
roof, and its shirt-sleeved chorister; but, my strait-laced friends, if
you strain at a harmless marble Cupid, how could you swallow an electric
flesh-and-blood ballet-dancer? Such as we are wont to see in this house?
I have tried to educate myself up to it, but may I be pinched this
minute if I do not catch myself diligently perusing the play-bill,
whenever they execute one of their astounding rotary <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas</span></em>. I can&#8217;t
stand it; and yet my friends, at the risk of being excommunicated, allow
me to say, that I would rather stand a ballet-dancer&#8217;s chance of getting
to heaven, than that of many a vinegar-visaged saint of high repute in
your churches.</p>

<p class="new_para">But this is a digression. Just see those women seating themselves <em>on
the stage</em>. Saucy as I am, I could not do that; nor, if I did, would I
put my feet upon the rounds of a chair in front of me&mdash;and the
audience. How patriarchal Solon Robinson looks, with his clear, calm
face, and his long, snow-white beard! He is quite a picture. What a pity
he ever burned his fingers with &ldquo;Hot Corn.&rdquo; But let him throw the first
stone who has never by one well-meant, but mistaken act of his life,
called forth the regretful &ldquo;what a pity!&rdquo; The river which never
overflows its banks may never devastate, nor&mdash;does it ever freshen
the distant and arid Sahara.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> Many a poor man has blessed, and
will bless, the name of Solon Robinson; and many a hard-toiling woman,
too, whom he has instructed how to procure the most nutriment for her
starving children from an old bone or a couple of onions. Let those who
make wry mouths at &ldquo;Hot Corn,&rdquo; taste his &ldquo;poor man&#8217;s soup,&rdquo; and do
justice to the active brain and philanthropic heart of its originator.</p>

<p class="new_para">I used to think the &ldquo;New York Tribune,&rdquo; of which Solon is agricultural
editor, a great institution, until I discovered two things: first, the
number of able, talented, practical men employed in its getting up;
secondly, that a <em>bull&#8217;s head</em> is kept constantly seething in the
machine boiler to impart a wholesome ferocity to its paragraphs!</p>

<p class="new_para">Hush! here comes the speaker of the evening&mdash;John B. Gough,
supported by Dr. Tyng (who believes in preaching to dear little
children, as well as to their fathers and mothers). John says, &ldquo;Ladies
and gentlemen&rdquo; (not&mdash;<em>Gentlemen</em> and ladies, as do some ungallant
orators). &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, when the admission tickets are
twenty-five cents I feel doubtful of giving you your money&#8217;s worth;
judge then how a fifty cent ticket embarrasses me.&rdquo; A very politic
preface, John; but ere you had spoken five consecutive sentences, I knew
it was mock-modesty. You know very well that no man understands better
how to sway a crowd; you know that many an audience, who yawn through
addresses that are squared, rounded, and plumb-ed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> nicest
rules of rhetoric, will sit spell-bound unconscious hours, and laugh and
cry at <em>your</em> magnetic will. John, you are a good and a great
institution, and right glad am I that the noble cause in which your
eloquence is enlisted, has so pleasing and indomitable a defender.</p>

<p class="new_para">But John&mdash;it is not all in <em>you</em>. Double-edged is the sword wielded
in a <em>just</em> cause; and not a man, woman, or child has listened to your
burning words to-night who did not know and feel that you spoke God&#8217;s
truth.</p>

<p class="new_para">Success to the Temperance cause, and all its apostles, both great and
small; and above all, <em>never</em> let <em>woman&#8217;s</em> lip baptize the bowl, which,
for aught she can tell, may sepulcher her dearest hopes this side
heaven.</p>

<h2>WAYSIDE WORDS.</h2>

<p class="new_para">I wonder is there a country on the face of the earth, where the Almighty
is oftener called upon to send to perdition the souls of those who
offend its inhabitants? Everywhere that horrid imprecation, so familiar
that it is unnecessary to shock you by writing it, meets the pained ear.
I say pained, because I, for one, can not abhor it less on account of
its frequency, or consider it less disgusting, because it filters
through aristocratic lips. Everywhere it pursues me; in crowded streets,
on ferry boats, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> omnibusses, and, I am sorry to say, in
ladies&#8217; parlors, which should afford a refuge from this disgusting
habit.</p>

<p class="new_para">From old men&mdash;whose toothless lips mumble it almost inarticulately;
from those who would resent to the death any question of their claim to
the title of gentlemen; from young men, glorious else, in the strength
and vigor of youth; and sadder still&mdash;from little children, who
have caught the trick, and bandy curses at their sports. <em>An oath from a
child&#8217;s lips!</em> One would as soon expect a thunderbolt from out the heart
of a rose. And yet, there are those who deliberately <em>teach</em> little
children to swear, and think it sport, when the rosy lips, with childish
grace, lisp the demoniac lesson.</p>

<p class="new_para">An oath from a <em>woman&#8217;s</em> lips! With shuddering horror we shrink away,
and ask, what bitter cup of wrong, suffering, and despair, man has
doomed her to drink to the dregs, ere she could so belie her beautiful
womanhood.</p>

<p class="new_para">One lovely moonlight night, I was returning late from the opera, with a
gentleman friend, the delicious tones I had heard still floating through
my charmed brain. Suddenly from out a dark angle in a building we
passed, issued a woman; old, not in years, but in misery, for her long,
brown hair curtained a face whose beauty had been its owner&#8217;s direst
curse. To my dying day I shall never forget the horrid oaths of that
wretched woman as she faced the moonlight and me. Perhaps I had
evoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> some vision of happier days, when she, too, had a
protecting arm to lean upon; sure I am, could she have read my heart,
she would not have cursed me. But oh, the wide gulf between what she
must have been and what she was! Oh, the dreadful reckoning to be
required at the hands of him who defaced this temple of the living God,
and left it a shapeless, blackened ruin!</p>

<h2>CHARLOTTE BRONTE.</h2>

<p class="new_para">Who has not read &ldquo;Jane Eyre?&rdquo; and who has not longed to know the
personal history of its gifted author? At last we have it. Poor
Charlotte Bronte! So have I seen a little bird trying bravely with
outspread wings to soar, and as often beaten back by the gathering
storm-cloud&mdash;not discouraged&mdash;biding its time for another
trial&mdash;singing feebly its quivering notes as if to keep up its
courage&mdash;growing bolder in each essay till the eye ached in
watching its triumphant progress&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;into the clear
blue of heaven.</p>

<p class="new_para">Noble Charlotte Bronte! worthy to receive the baptism of fire which is
sent to purify earth&#8217;s gifted. I see her on the gloomy moors of Haworth,
in the damp parsonage-house&mdash;skirted by the grave-yard, sickening
with its unwholesome exhalations, crushing down, at the stern bidding of
duty, her gloomy thoughts and aspirations; tending patiently the
irri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>table sick, performing cheerfully the most menial household
offices; the days &ldquo;passing in a slow and dead march;&rdquo; cheered by no
mother&#8217;s loving smile, or rewarding kiss; waiting patiently upon the
hard, selfish, unsympathizing father, who saw, one by one, his gifted
daughters sink into untimely graves, for want of the love, and sympathy,
and companionship for which their yearning hearts were aching.</p>

<p class="new_para">I see these sisters at night, released from toil, when their father had
retired to rest, denied the cheerful candle-light, pacing up and down,
in utter darkness, the dreary little sitting-room, talking of the vacant
past and present, and trying vainly to pierce the impenetrable future
for one glimmering ray of hope; and as years passed on, and vision after
vision faded away&mdash;alas! with those who wove them&mdash;I see
Charlotte, the last survivor of that little group, pacing <em>alone</em> that
desolate sitting-room; while the winds that swept over the bleak moor,
and through the church-yard, and howled about the windows, seemed to the
excited imagination of the lonely, feeble watcher, like the voices of
her sisters shrieking to be again enfolded in her warm, sisterly
embrace. Alone&mdash;<em>all</em> alone!&mdash;no shoulder to weep
upon&mdash;no loving sister&#8217;s hand to creep about her waist&mdash;the
voices of her soul crying eternally, unceasingly, vainly, Give,
give&mdash;and he who gave her life, sleeping, eating, drinking, as
stoically as if ten thousand deaths were not compressed, to that feeble
girl, into each agonized moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">One smiles now, when the praise of &ldquo;Jane Eyre&rdquo; is on every tongue, at
the weary way the author&#8217;s thumbed manuscript traveled from publisher to
publisher, seeking a resting-place, and finding none; and when at length
it did appear in book form&mdash;the caution of the sapient
book-dissecting &ldquo;London Athenæum&rdquo; containing only &ldquo;very qualified
admissions of the power of the author&rdquo;&mdash;also of &ldquo;The Literary
Gazette,&rdquo; which &ldquo;considered it unsafe to pronounce upon an unknown
author;&rdquo; also at &ldquo;The Daily News,&rdquo; which &ldquo;did not review
novels&rdquo;&mdash;but found time soon afterward to notice others. Mistaken
gentlemen! you were yet, like some others of your class, to take off
your publishing and editorial hats to the little woman who was destined
to a world-wide fame, but&mdash;and if ye have manly hearts they must
have ached ere now to think of it&mdash;not until the bitter cup of
privation and sorrow had been so nearly drained to the dregs by those
quivering lips, that the laurel wreath, so bravely, hardly won, was
twined with the cypress vine.</p>

<p class="new_para">Literary fame! alas&mdash;what is it to a <em>loving</em> woman&#8217;s heart, save
that it lifts her out of the miry pit of poverty and toil? To have one&#8217;s
glowing thoughts handled, twisted, and distorted by coarse fingers; to
shed scalding tears over the gravest charge which can be untruthfully
brought against a woman&#8217;s pen; to bear it, writhing in silence, and have
that silence misconstrued, or speak in your own defense, and be called
unwomanly; to be a target<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> for slander, envy, and
misrepresentation, by those of both sexes who can not look upon a
shining garment without a wish to defile it&mdash;all this, a man&#8217;s
shoulders may be broad enough to bear, but she must be a strong <em>woman</em>
who does not stagger under it.</p>

<p class="new_para">I see Charlotte Bronte in the little parsonage parlor, at Haworth,
draperied, hung with pictures, furnished, at last, with books from the
proceeds of her own pen; and upon the vacant chairs upon which should
have sat the toiling, gifted sisters, over whom the grave had closed, I
see inscribed, Too late&mdash;Too late! and I look at its delicate and
only inmate, and trace the blue veins on her transparent temples, and
say, Too late!&mdash;even for <em>thee</em>&mdash;Too late! Happiness is not
happiness if it be not shared&mdash;it turns to misery. But, thank God,
at last came the delirious draught of love, even for so brief a space,
to those thirsting lips&mdash;but which, incredible as it may seem, the
father, in his selfishness, would have dashed aside; relenting at last,
he gave up this tender, shrinking flower to more appreciative keeping;
but the blast had been too keen that had gone before&mdash;the storms
too rough&mdash;the sky too inclement. We read of a wedding, the
happiness of which the selfish father must cloud at the last moment, by
refusing, for some inexplicable reason, or no reason at all, to give
away the bride in person according to episcopal usage&mdash;we read of a
short bridal tour&mdash;of a return to a love-beautified,
love-sanctified home&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>we read of a pleasant walk of the
happy pair&mdash;of a slight cold taken on that occasion&mdash;of a
speedy delirium&mdash;of a conscious moment, in which the new-made bride
opened wide her astonished eyes upon her kneeling husband, pleading with
God to spare her precious life; and we read the heart-rending
exclamation of the latter as the truth flashed upon her clouded
intellect&mdash;&ldquo;O! I am not to die <em>now</em>?&mdash;when we have been so
happy?&rdquo; and with streaming eyes we turn away from the corpse of
Charlotte Bronte.</p>
